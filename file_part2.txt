#### Nature

Everyone plays a role, often several, every day. Everyindividual displays multiple layers of personality, varying from the contrived to the sincere. Each of theseroles defines how we interact with the people and places around us, and we choose which parts of ourselveswe wish to show.It is the same with Kindred. The concept of Natureand Demeanor corresponds directly to the differentmasks we wear when we interact. A Vampire character’s Nature is her true self, her innermost being — theperson she truly is. It is dangerous to show this, though,as it lets others know who we are and what is importantto us. Thus, characters also have Demeanors, faces they show to the world. By choosing how we relate to theworld, we are able to choose how it relates to us as well,as we guide the responses others give us.Philosophy aside, personality also has an effect onthe mechanics of Vampire. A character may regainher drive and sense of purpose by acting in accordancewith her Nature. Every time a chara
cter fulfills the requirement of her Nature Archetype (see below), thatcharacter has the opportunity to regain a point of spentWillpower (see p. 267). If the Storyteller allows, thecharacter regains the point.Archetypes allow players to build a sense of personality for their characters, and to define a bit of whatmakes the character tick. It is worth noting that Archetypes are not rigid; characters need not slavishlydevote themselves to their Natures and Demeanors.Rather, the character should act as the player reasonably or emotionally believes she would act in a givensituation. Players and Storytellers may wish to definetheir own Archetypes that more closely exemplify howthe character in question responds to her surroundings.After all, every character is an individual, and customized Archetypes should be a logical outgrowth of awell-rounded character.Here are some example character Archetypes for awide variety of characters. Some Archetypes are bettersuited for certain Sects or Clans
 than others.



--Architect

	*The Architect has a sense of purpose even greaterthan herself. She is truly happy only when creatingsomething of lasting value for others. People will always need things, and the Architect strives to provideat least one necessity. Inventors, pioneers, town founders, entrepreneurs, and the like are all Architect Archetypes. A Kindred Architect might seek to createnew laws that affect her fellow undead, or she mightaim to establish a new Anarch domain.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you establish something of importance or lasting value.



--Autocrat

	*The Autocrat wants to be in charge. He seeks prominence for its own sake, not because he has an operation’s best interests at heart or because he has the bestideas (though he may certainly think so). He may genuinely believe others are incompetent, but ultimatelyhe craves power and control. Dictators, gang leaders,bullies, corporate raiders, and their ilk are AutocratArchetypes. A Kindred Autocrat may crave a title, or he may wish to be recognized as the leader of a coterie.— Regain a point of Willpower when you achievecontrol over a group or organization involving otherindividuals.



--Bon Vivant

	*The Bon Vivant knows that life — and unlife — isshallow and meaningless. As such, the Bon Vivantdecides to enjoy her time on Earth. The Bon Vivantis not necessarily irresponsible. Rather, she is simplypredisposed to having a good time along the way. MostBon Vivants have low Self-Control ratings, as they areso given to excess. Hedonists, sybarites, and dilettantesare all examples of the Bon Vivant Archetype. A Kindred Bon Vivant may sire a brood of fawning childer,or he may spend his time gorging on the blood of drugabusers for the contact high.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you trulyenjoy yourself and can fully express your exultation. Atthe Storyteller’s option, a particularly fabulous revelmay yield multiple Willpower points.



--Bravo

	*The Bravo is a tough and a bully, and often takes perverse pleasure in tormenting the weak. To the Bravo’smind, might makes right. Power is what matters, andonly those with power should be respected. Naturally,physical power is the best kind, but any kind will do.The Bravo sees overt threats as a perfectly reasonablemeans of gaining cooperation. The Bravo is not incapable of pity or kindness; he just prefers to do things hisway. Robbers, bigots, and thugs are all Bravo Archetypes. A Kindred Bravo may abuse authority the systemhas granted him, or he may — violently or otherwise— force other Kindred out of his way to get what hewants. He’s almost certainly an asshole.— Regain a point of Willpower any time you achieveyour agenda through brutishness or intimidation. Thisneed not be physical, as many Bravos verbally or socially cow their victims.



--Capitalist

	*You are the ultimate mercenary, realizing that thereis always a market to be developed — anything can be acommodity. You have a keen understanding of how tomanipulate both kine and Cainites into thinking thatthey need specific goods or services. Appearance andinfluence are everything when it comes to the big sale,though you’ll use anything to your advantage. Salesmen, soldiers of fortune, and bootlickers all adhere tothe Capitalist Archetype.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you makea successful “sale” of any commodity. Commoditiesneed not be physical items; they may be bits of information, favors, or other intangibles.



--Caregiver

	*Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. A Caregivertakes her comfort in consoling others, and people often come to her with their problems. Vampires withCaregiver Archetypes often attempt, as best they can,to protect the mortals on whom they feed. Nurses,doctors, and psychiatrists are examples of potentialCaregivers. Caregiver Kindred are often the type who— tragically — Embrace mortal loves they’ve left behind in hopes of softening their loss, or even those whocreate situations of grief in order to ease it and thusvalidate themselves.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you successfully protect or nurture someone else.



--Celebrant

	*The Celebrant takes joy in her cause. Whether thecharacter’s passion is battle, religion, foiling her rivals,or reading fine literature, it gives the Celebrant thestrength to withstand adversity. Given the chance, theCelebrant will indulge in her passion as deeply as possible. Unlike the Fanatic (p. 91), the Celebrant pursues her cause not out of duty, but out of enthusiasm.Crusaders, hippies, political activists, and art enthusiasts are Celebrant Archetypes. Celebrant Kindred maycleave to mortal ideologies that are incongruous withtheir new Damned conditions, or they may be the advocates of new trends and causes that move throughundead society.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you pursueyour cause or convert another character to the samepassion. Conversely, lose a point of temporary Willpower whenever you are denied your passion or it isbadly lost to you.



--Chameleon

	*Independent and self-reliant, you carefully studythe behavior and mannerisms of everyone you comein contact with so you can pass yourself off as someoneelse later. You spend so much time altering your mannerisms and appearance that your own sire may noteven recognize you. Spies, con artists, drag queens, andimpostors best represent the Chameleon. — Regain a point of Willpower whenever you foolsomeone into thinking you’re someone else for yourown (or your pack or coterie‘s) benefit.



--Child

	*The Child is still immature in personality and temperament. He wants what he wants now, and often prefers someone to give it to him. Although he can typically care for himself, he would rather have someonecater to his capricious desires. Some Child Archetypesare actually innocent rather than immature, ignorantof the cold ways of the real world. Actual children,spoiled individuals, and some drug abusers are ChildArchetypes. Kindred with the Child Archetype mighthave not yet fully reached an understanding of theworld and have some characteristic such as cruelty, entitlement, sympathy, or hunger that is out of balancewith their other personality aspects, as they haven’t yetreached the “rounded” state of adulthood. Note that aChild Archetype need not be a physical, literal child atthe time of Embrace. Some people simply never growup.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you manage to convince someone to help you with no gain toherself, or to nurture you.



--Competitor

	*The Competitor takes great excitement in the pursuit of victory. To the Competitor, every task is a newchallenge to meet and a new contest to win. Indeed,the Competitor sees all interactions as some sort of opportunity for her to be the best — the best leader, themost productive, the most valuable, or whatever. Corporate raiders, professional athletes, and impassionedresearchers are all examples of Competitor Archetypes.Kindred Competitors have any number of resourcesand accomplishments over which to assert themselves,from mortal herds and creature comforts to titles andprestige in Kindred society.— Regain one point of Willpower whenever yousucceed at a test or challenge. Note that a test or challenge is more than just a dice roll; it’s an entire dramatic situation. Especially difficult victories may, atthe Storyteller’s discretion, allow you to regain multiple Willpower points.



--Conformist

	*The Conformist is a follower, taking another’s leadand finding security in the decisions of others. She prefers not to take charge, instead seeking to throw in withthe rest of the group and lend her own unique aid. The Conformist is drawn to the most dynamic personalityor the individual she perceives to be the “best.” Beinga Conformist is not necessarily a bad thing — everygroup needs followers to lend stability to their causes.Groupies, party voters, and “the masses” are Conformist Archetypes. Conformist Kindred can take manyforms, from the ardent Sabbat pack member, to theKindred who follows a Clan-first agenda, to the trustedsupporters of a titled vampire or rising star.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever the groupor your supported leader achieves a goal due to yoursupport.



--Conniver

	*Why work for something when you can trick somebody else into getting it for you? The Conniver alwaystries to find the easy way, the fast track to success andwealth. Some people call him a thief, a swindler, orless pleasant terms, but he knows that everybody in theworld would do unto him if they could. He just doesit first, and better. Criminals, con artists, salespeople,urchins, and entrepreneurs might be Connivers. Somewould argue that all Kindred are Connivers in somesense, but those that have the Conniver archetype maybe abusive to their childer and ghouls, or they may bemore persuasive in gaining support for their machinations. never more than half-full, though it may be damn nearempty when other people are involved. Many Internet junkies, pop-culture fans, and Generation Xers areCurmudgeons. Kindred Curmudgeons see elder oppression or spoiled neonates running amok behind everydevelopment in undead society, and may or may notrise beyond acerbic grumbling to change any problemsth
ey perceive.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever someonedoes something specific and negative, just like you saidthey would. You must predict and quantify this failure aloud, such as by warning, “The Prince is goingto fuck us on this one,” or “Just watch, that Malkavian’s ghoul is going to do something really reckless.”You may simply whisper your prophecy of grief to theStoryteller if you wish, instead of announcing it to thewhole troupe.



--Dabbler

	*The Dabbler is interested in everything but focuseson nothing. He flits from idea to idea, passion to passion, and project to project without actually finishinganything. Others may get swept up in the Dabbler’senthusiasm, and be left high and dry when he moveson to something else without warning. Most Dabblershave high Intelligence, Charisma, and Manipulationratings, but not much in the way of Wits or Stamina.Toreador are often Dabblers, particularly those afflicted with the derisive sobriquet “Poseurs.” — Regain a point of Willpower whenever you tricksomeone into doing something for you, or when youconvince someone to help you against their own bestinterests. — Regain Willpower whenever you find a new enthusiasm and drop your old one completely.



--Creep Show

	*You strive to shock and disgust those around you withgratuitous acts and ostentatiously “evil” mannerisms.You realize, of course, that it’s all show and merely away to intimidate and control others. Outsiders, on theother hand, think you are the Devil incarnate, and yourevel in this image. Shock-rockers, rebellious teenagers, circus freaks, and the attention-starved exemplifythe Creep Show Archetype.



--Deviant

	*The Deviant is a freak, ostracized from society byunique tastes or beliefs that place her outside the mainstream. Deviants are not indolent rebels or shiftless“unrecognized geniuses”; rather, they are independentthinkers who don’t quite fit in the status quo. Deviant Archetypes often feel that the world stands againstthem, and as such reject traditional morality. Somehave bizarre tastes, preferences, and ideologies. Extremists, eccentric celebrities, and straight-up weirdoesare Deviant Archetypes. Kindred deviants may observeheretical or outlawed habits like diablerie or deferenceto elders, and they may well go Anarch or Autarkisinstead of having to constantly defend their subversionof Traditions or Sect customs. — Regain a point of Willpower whenever someonerecoils from you in horror or otherwise reacts in fear.



--Curmudgeon

	*A Curmudgeon is bitter and cynical, finding flawsin everything and seeing little humor in life or unlife.He is often fatalistic or pessimistic, and has very littleesteem for others. To the Curmudgeon, the glass is — Regain a point of Willpower any time you are ableto flout social mores without retribution.



--Director

	*To the Director, nothing is worse than chaos anddisorder. The Director seeks to be in charge, adopting a “my way or the highway” attitude on matters ofdecision-making. The Director is more concerned withbringing order out of strife, however, and need not betruly “in control” of a group to guide it. Coaches, teachers, and many political figures exemplify the DirectorArchetype. Kindred Directors may be simple advocatesof established codes, or they may prove instrumental intearing down corrupt existing orders to make way fornew leaders or factional movements.— Regain a point of Willpower when you influenceor aid a group or influential individual in the completion of a difficult task.



--Enigma

	*Your actions are bizarre, puzzling, and inexplicableto everyone except yourself. Your strangeness may be aresidual effect from your Embrace, or the most effectiveway for you to carry out your work. To the rest of theworld, however, your erratic actions suggest that you’reeccentric if not completely crazy. Conspiracy theorists,deep-cover agents, and Jyhad fanatics all live up to theEnigma Archetype— Regain a point of Willpower whenever someoneis completely perplexed or baffled by one of your actions that later turns out to be a fruitful endeavor.



--Eye of the Storm

	*Despite your calm appearance, chaos and havocseems to follow you. From burning cities to emotionalupheaval, death and destruction circle you like albatrosses. For you, unlife is a never-ending trial with uncertainty around every corner. Gang leaders, politicalfigures, and other influential individuals exemplify theEye of the Storm Archetype.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever a ruckus,riot, or less violent but equally chaotic phenomenonoccurs around you.



--Fanatic

	*The Fanatic has a purpose, and that purpose consumes his existence. The Fanatic pours himself intohis cause, and he may even feel guilty for undertakingany objective that deviates from his higher goal. Tothe Fanatic, the end justifies the means — the cause ismore important than those who serve it. Players whochoose Fanatic Archetypes must select a cause for their character to further. Revolutionaries, zealots, and sincere firebrands are all examples of Fanatic Archetypes.Kindred Fanatics are often champions for or againsta particular aspect of undead society, such as equalityamong all vampires, the extermination of Anarchs, orstamping infernalism out of the Sword of Caine.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you accomplish some task that directly relates to your cause.



--Gallant

	*Gallants are flamboyant souls, always seeking attention and the chance to be the brightest star. Gallantsseek the company of others, if only to earn their adoration. Attention drives the Gallant, and the chase isoften as important as its end. Nothing excites a Gallant so much as a new audience to woo. Performers,only children, and those with low self-esteem oftenembody the Gallant Archetype. Kindred Gallants maybe Harpies, or they may have enormous herds of dotingthralls.— Regain a Willpower point whenever you successfully impress another person. Ultimately, the Storyteller is the arbiter of how much you dazzle someone, evenin the case of other players’ characters.



--Guru

	*Your enlightenment draws others to you. You maybe a mentor of a particular Path of Enlightenment, apriest with the Church, or merely an idealist. Whatever the case, your presence motivates and moves othersto engage in spiritual or ideological pursuits. Your peersview you as calm, centered, and “with it,” even whenyou are preaching violence as a means to an end. Cultleaders, Zen masters, and Pack Priests are examples ofGurus.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever someoneseeks out your help in spiritual matters and your guidance moves that individual to an enlightened actionthat he normally would not have taken. Also, regain apoint of Willpower whenever you achieve an epiphanythat relates to your personal philosophy.



--Idealist

	*The Idealist believes — truly, madly, deeply — insome higher goal or morality. The object of his idealism may be something as pragmatic as the Camarilla’seventual triumph or as amorphous as the ultimategood, but the belief is there. Idealists are frequently either very new to the Blood or very old, and many seek Golconda as the final expression of their idealism. Inthe meantime, an Idealist tries to reconcile his beliefswith the demands of vampiric existence, often actingcontrary to his self-interest in doing so.— Regain a point of Willpower any time an actionin pursuit of your ideals furthers your goals and bringsyour ideal closer to fruition.



--Judge

	*The Judge perpetually seeks to improve the system.A Judge takes pleasure in her rational nature and ability to draw the right conclusion when presented withfacts. The Judge respects justice, as it is the most efficient model for resolving issues. Judges, while they pursue the “streamlining” of problems, are rarely visionary,as they prefer proven models to insight. Engineers, lawyers, and doctors are often Judge Archetypes. KindredJudges might gravitate toward enforcement roles in local society, or they might be a voice of reason in anotherwise radical coterie.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you correctly solve a problem by considering the evidencepresented, or when one of your arguments unites dissenting parties.



--Loner

	*Even in a crowd the Loner sticks out, because heso obviously does not belong. Others view Loners aspariahs, remote, and isolated, but in truth the Lonerprefers his own company to that of others. For whatever reason, the Loner simply disdains others, and thisfeeling is often reciprocated. Criminals, radicals, andfree thinkers are all Loner Archetypes. Kindred Lonersoften hail from one of the rugged individualist Clanslike the Gangrel or Ravnos, and they have a proclivity for ending up Autarkis by dint of not giving a shitwhat some up-his-own-ass Prince or Archbishop saysis a law.— Regain a point of Willpower when you accomplish something by yourself, yet which still benefits thecoterie in some way.



--Martyr

	*The Martyr suffers for his cause, enduring his trialsout of the belief that his discomfort will ultimately improve others’ lot. Some Martyrs simply want the attention or sympathy their ordeals engender, while others are sincere in their cause, greeting their oppositionwith unfaltering faith. Many revolutionaries, staunch idealists, and outcasts are Martyr Archetypes. KindredMartyrs are often associated with reform movementsamong Kindred society, but rarely as figureheads —and they need not necessarily be on the pro-reformside of the issue.— Regain a point of Willpower when you suffersome amount of damage or loss of a definable resourcefor your ideals or another’s immediate gain.



--Masochist

	*The Masochist exists to test his limits, to see howmuch pain he can tolerate before he collapses. Hegains satisfaction in humiliation, suffering, denial, andeven physical pain. The Masochist defines who he isby his capacity to feel discomfort — he rises each nightonly to greet a new pain. Certain extreme athletes, urban tribalists, and the clinically depressed exemplifythe Masochist Archetype. Kindred Masochists mightbe overtly self-mortifying horrors who play to theirBeast’s self-destructive whims, or they may be ambitious taskmasters, as with a coterie leader who refusesto accept failure and pushes his own limits in his exacting schemes.— Regain one point of Willpower when your ownsuffering leads to some tangible gain for you, and twopoints of Willpower whenever you experience pain ina truly unique way.



--Monster

	*The Monster knows she is a creature of darknessand acts like it. Evil and suffering are the Monster’stools, and she uses them wherever she goes. No villainy is below her, no hurt goes uninflicted, and no lieremains untold. The Monster does not commit evil forits own sake, but rather as a means to understand whatshe has become. Unstable individuals, those who havebeen greatly wronged or harmed, and those defined associopaths may come to display characteristics of theMonster Archetype. Kindred Monsters include manySabbat, degenerate Kindred elders, and those who never adjust properly to what they have become after theEmbrace.— Malignant deeds reinforce the Monster’s senseof purpose. Monster characters should pick a specificatrocity, regaining Willpower whenever they indulgethat urge. For example, a tempter regains Willpowerfor luring someone into wickedness, while an apostateearns back Willpower for causing another to doubt herfaith. Pick a destiny and fulfill it. Storytellers, 
be careful with how you reward this Archetype. For example, a player who chooses violence as an atrocity shouldn’trecoup Willpower in every combat, but perhaps onlyin those that involve wanton destruction, or evencause degeneration checks due to their gruesomeness.Monster is a difficult Archetype for which to offer rewards, and those rewards should come as a result of thecharacter challenging his own descent into the Beast,not rampaging ungovernably because he gains an everrefreshing pool of bonus dice.



--Pedagogue

	*The Pedagogue knows it all, and desperately wants toinform others. Whether through a sense of purpose ora genuine desire to help others, the Pedagogue makessure his message is heard — at length, if necessary.Pedagogue Archetypes may range from well-meaningmentors to verbose blowhards who love to hear themselves talk. Instructors, the overeducated, and “veterans of their field” are all examples of Pedagogue Archetypes. Kindred Pedagogues include watchdogs ofthe Traditions, ideological Anarchs, and perhaps eventhat rare soul seeking Golconda who wants companyon the journey. — Regain one point of Willpower whenever you seeor learn of someone who has benefited from the wisdom you shared with them.



--Penitent

	*The Penitent exists to atone for the grave sin she commits simply by being who she is. Penitents have eitherlow self-esteem or traumatic past experiences, and feelcompelled to “make up” for inflicting themselves uponthe world. Penitent Archetypes are not always religiousin outlook; some truly want to scourge the world of thegrief they bring to it. Repentant sinners, persons withlow self-esteem, and remorseful criminals are examplesof the Penitent Archetype. Penitent Kindred includethose who scourge themselves of the Beast like medievalmonks, vampires who stand up for the rights of mortals,and those who subsist entirely on the vitae of animals.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you feelthat you have achieved absolution for a given grievance. This redemption should be of the same magnitude as the transgression — the greater the crime, thegreater the penance. The Storyteller is the ultimate arbiter of what constitutes a reasonable act of reparation.



--Perfectionist

	*Perfectionist Archetypes demand flawless execution.A half-hearted job gives the Perfectionist no satisfaction, and she expects the same degree of commitmentand attention to detail from others that she demandsfrom herself. Although the Perfectionist may be exacting, the achievement of the end goal drives her, andoften those for whom she is responsible. Prima donnas, artists, and architects exemplify the PerfectionistArchetype. A Perfectionist Kindred might be a zealous Sabbat member who expects more than his packcan consistently deliver, or she may be a moralist whosometimes applies her own high standards of Humanityto others in her coterie.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you accomplish your goal without any demonstrable flaw orimpediment, and regain a Willpower point wheneveryou motivate another character to succeed as a resultof your own shining example.



--Rebel

	*The Rebel is a malcontent, never satisfied with thestatus quo or the system as it is. He hates the very ideaof authority and does everything in his power to challenge and undermine it. Perhaps the Rebel truly believes in his ideals, but it is just as likely that he bearsauthority figures some ill will over a “wrong” done tohim in the past. A Rebel may hate institutions categorically, or she may be consumed with opposition towarda single particular authority. Teenagers, insurrectionists, and nonconformists all exemplify the Rebel Archetype. Rebel Kindred certainly include the Sabbat,Anarchs, and temperamental Brujah, but also haveroom for Tremere who chafe at the rigid Clan hierarchy or neonates who deplore their sires.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever your actions adversely affect your chosen opposition. Rebelsmay oppose the government, the Church, a vampirePrince, or any other holder of authority. The playershould choose whom or what his character rebelsagainst when he a
dopts this Archetype. Storytellersshould take rebellion against “all authority” with agrain of salt, and apply the Willpower reward for sucha broad concept to only greater and greater actions ofinsurgency.



--Rogue

	*Only one thing matters to the Rogue: herself. Toeach his own, and if others cannot protect their claims, they have no right to them. The Rogue is not necessarily a thug or bully, however. She simply refuses tosuccumb to the whims of others. Rogues almost universally possess a sense of self-sufficiency. They have theirown best interests in mind at all times. Prostitutes,capitalists, and criminals all embody the Rogue Archetype. Kindred Rogues include diablerists, Autarkis, anda Primogen who puts his Clan’s opportunities beforethe supremacy of the Kindred as a whole.— Regain a point of Willpower when your self-centered disposition leads you to profit, materially or otherwise. At the Storyteller’s discretion, accumulatinggain without exposing your own weaknesses may letyou regain two points of Willpower. As well, you mayregain a point of Willpower when your efforts benefitthe group to which you belong when that benefit comesat the expense of another group.



--Sadist

	*You exist to inflict pain and suffering upon others.Killing is too easy; torture is the best way to truly harma person, and you seek the slowest, most painful meansto push others to the ultimate limits. Pain — others’pain — gives you immense pleasure. Drill sergeants,jilted ex-lovers, and some of the terminally derangedmay all embody the Sadist Archetype at one time oranother; sadism is rare enough to appear only in aberrant cases, rather than reliably in any type or class ofperson.— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you inflictpain upon someone for no reason other than your ownpleasure.



--Scientist

	*To a Scientist, existence is a puzzle which she canhelp to reassemble. A Scientist logically and methodically examines her every situation and maneuver, looking for logical outcomes and patterns. This is not to saythat the Scientist is always looking for a scientific orrational explanation, but rather she examines her surroundings rigorously and with a critical eye. The system a Scientist attempts to impose on the world maybe completely ludicrous, but it is a system, and shesticks by it.— Regain Willpower any time a logical, systematicapproach to a problem helps you solve it, or information gathered logically is of use in another, similar situation.



--Sociopath

	*All inferior beings both living and undead shouldbe exterminated in order to bring about a harmonious existence. You likely feel no remorse when youkill (depending upon your Humanity or Path). Onthe contrary, you are doing a glorious deed for society.Some vampires are critical of your violent nature, butyou sometimes manage to sway them with argumentslike, “Darwin would agree that I’m only helping naturealong!” and, “Only the strongest shall survive!”— Regain Willpower whenever you are the greatestcontributor to a body count after everything has settleddown. This count includes times when you are the onlykiller, and it needs not result from a massive combat —like killing every member of a movie audience or gunning down defenseless patrons in a bank robbery.



--Soldier

	*The Soldier is not a blindly loyal follower. Whileshe exists for orders, she does not adhere to them unquestioningly. More independent than a Conformistbut too tied into the idea of command to be a Loner, the Soldier applies her own techniques to others’goals. While she may seek command herself someday,her ambitions lie within the established hierarchy andstructure. The Soldier has no compunctions about using whatever means necessary to do what needs to bedone, so long as the orders to do so came from the rightplace.— Regain a point of Willpower when you achieveyour orders’ objectives. The more difficult the ordersare to fulfill, the better it feels to accomplish them. AtStoryteller discretion, pulling off a spectacular successor fulfilling a lengthy mission may well be worth additional Willpower points.



--Survivor

	*No matter what happens, no matter the odds or opposition, the Survivor always manages to pull through.Whether alone or with a group, the Survivor’s utterrefusal to accept defeat often makes the difference between success and failure. Survivors are frustrated byothers’ acceptance of “what fate has in store” or willingness to withstand less than what they can achieve.Outcasts, street folk, and idealists may well be SurvivorArchetypes. A Kindred Survivor might be a renegadeunder a Prince’s edict of Blood Hunt, an erstwhileBishop forced from power, or a lowly Nosferatu whofinds himself kicked from hunting ground to huntingground with no acknowledged claim of domain. — Regain one point of Willpower whenever you survive a threatening situation through tenacity, or whenyour counsel causes someone else to persist in spite ofopposition.



--Thrill-Seeker

	*The Thrill-Seeker lives for the rush of danger. Unlike those of arguably saner disposition, the ThrillSeeker actively pursues hazardous and possibly deadlysituations. The Thrill-Seeker is not consciously suicidal or self-destructive — he simply seeks the stimulation of imminent disaster. Gangbangers, petty thieves,and exhibitionists are all examples of the Thrill-SeekerArchetype. Kindred Thrill-Seekers might habituallybreak the Masquerade just to see if they’ll get caught,they might maintain contacts in a rival Clan or Sect,or they might actively plot a Prince’s overthrow just tosee if they can pull it off.— Regain a point of Willpower any time you succeed at a dangerous task that you have deliberately undertaken. Thrill-Seekers are not stupid, however, andthe Storyteller may choose not to reward a player whoheedlessly sends her character into danger for the soleintent of harvesting Willpower.



--Traditionalist

	*The orthodox ways satisfy the Traditionalist, whoprefers to accomplish her goals with time-tested methods. Why vary your course when what has worked inthe past is good enough? The Traditionalist finds thestatus quo acceptable, even preferable, to a change thatmight yield unpredictable results. Conservatives, judges, and authority figures are all examples of Traditionalist Archetypes. Traditionalist Kindred unsurprisinglylook to the Traditions as a behavior model, though afew Anarchs and elders may espouse a “traditionalism”that predates both Camarilla and Sabbat.— Regain a point of Willpower any time the provenways turn out to be the best. Also, regain a point ofWillpower any time you adhere to one of your previously espoused positions and it proves to be a wisecourse of action.



--Trickster

	*The Trickster finds the absurd in everything. No matter how grim life (or unlife) may become, the Tricksteralways uncovers a kernel of humor within it. Tricksters cannot abide sorrow or pain, and so they strive tolighten the spirits of those around them. Some Tricksters have even higher ideals, challenging static dogma by exposing its failures in humorous ways. Comedians,satirists, and social critics are examples of TricksterArchetypes. Kindred Tricksters may call attention tothe flaws in a leader’s policy, they may be glib-tongueddevil’s advocates who question the Traditions or ritaeof their Sect, or they may simply have an acute senseof the ironies of a world that makes vampiric predatorand mortal prey almost indistinguishable physically.— Regain a point of Willpower any time you manageto lift others’ spirits, especially if you are able to assuageyour own pain in the process.



--Visionary

	*The Visionary is strong enough to look beyond themundane and perceive the truly wondrous. Visionariestest accepted societal limits, and seek what few othershave the courage to imagine. The Visionary rarely findssatisfaction in what society has to offer; she prefers toencourage society to offer what it could instead of whatit does. Typically, society responds poorly to Visionaries, though it is they who are responsible for bringingabout progress and change. Philosophers, inventors,and the most inspired artists often have VisionaryNatures. Kindred Visionaries may want to plunge allmortals into vampiric thrall, they may adapt technologies that other, more static Kindred fear or overlook,or they may have a “better way” to coexist with othervampires than all of this Prince-and-Regent nonsense.— Regain a point of Willpower each time you areable to convince others to have faith in your dreamsand follow the course of action dictated by your vision. Note that gaining support is the key
 to a Visionary regaining Willpower. Success need not come to aVisionary, at least not with every step in changing thestructures in question. Her greatest successes may indeed come after her Final Death.
