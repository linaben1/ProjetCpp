#### Virtues

The Virtue Traits define a character’s outlook on unlife — they shape a character’s ethical code and describe his commitment to his chosen morality. Virtuesexist to help give a character a sense of being, not toforce players to portray their characters in a given way.However, Kindred are passionate creatures, and sometimes an act or situation may force a character to consider exactly how she should react to a given stimulus.Virtues come into play when a character faces an impending frenzy, does something ethically questionable(according to the character’s morality), or confrontssomething that terrifies or disturbs her.A vampire’s Virtues are determined by his Path, theparticular code of ethics he follows. Most CamarillaKindred maintain their mortal values and follow thePath of Humanity (referred to simply as “Humanity”),but other vampires often subscribe to radically different philosophies. Humanity, Paths, and the alternateVirtues are discussed in Chapter Seven.At chara
cter creation, a character’s Humanity isequal to his Conscience + Self-Control Virtues.



--Conscience

	*Conscience is a Trait that allows characters to evaluate their conduct with relation to what is “right” and“wrong.” A character’s moral judgment with Consciencestems from her attitude and outlook. Conscience iswhat prevents a vampire from succumbing to the Beast,by defining the Beast’s urges as unacceptable. Conscience factors into the difficulty of many rolls toavoid committing a transgression. Additionally, Conscience determines whether or not a character losesHumanity by committing acts that do not uphold hermoral code (see “Degeneration,” p. 309). A characterwith a high Conscience rating feels remorse for transgressions, while a character with a lower Consciencemay be more callous or ethically lax.Some vampires replace the Conscience Virtue withthe Virtue of Conviction (p. 314); unless your Storyteller tells you it’s OK to do this, assume Conscience isused.

	1:Uncaring

	2:Normal

	3:Ethical

	4:Righteous

	5:Remorseful



--Self-Control

	*Self-Control defines a character’s discipline and mastery over the Beast. Characters with high Self-Controlrarely succumb to emotional urges, and are thus able torestrain their darker sides more readily than characterswith low Self-Control.Self-Control comes into play when a character facesher Beast in the form of frenzy (p. 298). Self-Controlallows the character to resist the frenzy. Note: A character may never roll more dice to resist or control afrenzy than she has in her blood pool — it’s hard todeny the Beast when one’s mind clouds with hunger.As with Conscience, Self-Control can be replaced,in this case by the Virtue of Instinct (p. 314). Again,unless the Storyteller specifically says it’s all right to doso, assume Self-Control is used.

	1:Unstable

	2:Normal

	3:Temperate

	4:Hardened

	5:Total self-mastery



--Courage

	*All characters have a Courage Trait, regardless ofthe Path they follow. Courage is the quality that allowscharacters to stand in the face of fear or daunting adversity. It is bravery, mettle, and stoicism combined. Acharacter with high Courage meets her fears head-on,while a character of lesser Courage may flee in terror.

	1:Timid

	2:Normal

	3:Bold

	4:Resolute

	5:Heroic



--Willpower

	*Willpower measures a character’s inner drive and competence at overcoming unfavorable odds. Unlike other Traits,Willpower has both a permanent rating and a temporarypool of points. The rating is rolled or tested, while thepool is spent. When a player spends a point of a character’sWillpower, she should cross off the point from the Willpower pool (the squares), not the Willpower rating (thecircles). The rating stays constant — if a character needsto roll Willpower for some reason, she bases the roll on thepermanent rating. The pool is used up during the story.A character’s Willpower pool will likely fluctuate a greatdeal during the course of a story or chronicle. It decreasesby one point every time a player uses a Willpower point toenable his character to do something extraordinary, likemaintain self-control or gain an automatic success. Eventually, the character will have no Willpower left, and will nolonger be able to exert the effort he once could. A characterwith no Willp
ower pool is exhausted mentally, physically,and spiritually, and will have great difficulty doing anything,as he can no longer muster the energy to undertake an action or cause. Willpower points can be regained during thecourse of a story, though players are advised to be frugalwith their characters’ Willpower pools.The Willpower Trait is measured on a 1-10 scale rather than a 1-5 scale. At character creation, a character’sWillpower is equal to his Courage Virtue. Kindred use the Courage Virtue when faced with circumstances they endemically dread: fire, sunlight, TrueFaith. See the section on Rötschreck (p. 299) for mechanical systems dealing with character fear.

	1:Spineless

	2:Weak

	3:Unassertive

	4:Diffident

	5:Certain

	6:Confident

	7:Determined

	8:Controlled

	9:Iron-willed

	10:Unshakable

	*Caitiff have no Clan-based Disciplines, just as they have no Clan. For them, the cost of raising all Disciplines is the CRx6. This is both the curse and the blessing of being Clanless.

	**Increasing a Virtue through experience does not increase Traits based on that Virtue (Humanity,Path, Willpower).

	**New path or Secondary path can be only Necromancy or Thaumaturgy

--Blood Pool

	*A character’s blood pool measures how much vitae thevampire has in his system. The blood pool comprises anumber of individual blood points. Each bloodpoint corresponds roughly to onetenth of the blood in an averageadult mortal (a pint or one-halfliter outside of a human).

	**A character at the Incapacitated health level is utterly immobilized and can take no action of any kindexcept healing himself with blood points (if the character is a vampire or ghoul) or swallowing blood thatis offered to him. A mortal who reaches this stage is abreath away from death; if she takes any more damage,she dies. If a Kindred suffers an aggravated wound (see p.285) after being Incapacitated, he dies the Final Death.A vampire at the Incapacitated health level with nomore blood in his body immediately sinks into torpor.

	**The maximum numberof blood points a vampiremay ingest is dictated by his Generation, as is the number of blood points he mayspend in a single turn. A vampire with zero blood points in hissystem is ravenously hungry and likelyin the throes of frenzy.More information on the blood poolis available in Chapter Six, under “Using Blood Pool” on p. 268.



--Health

	*The Health Trait measures a character’s physical condition, from perfecthealth to Final Death. As characters arewounded or otherwise impaired, theylose health levels, then regain them asthey heal. A character’s Health Traitconsists of seven different “health levels,” and each level applies a differentdice pool penalty to any actions takenby the person in question. A characterwho is Hurt subtracts one die from heraction dice pools, while a Crippled character subtracts five dice from her action dicepools. If health level penalties leave a character with no dice in a given dice pool, the charactercannot take that action. However, a point of Willpower can be spent to ignore wound penalties for one turn(see p. 282).

	**Note that dicepool penalties from health level loss apply only to actions. They do not apply to purely reflexivedice pools, such as soakdice, most Virtue checks, or Willpower rollsto abort to another action. If a character isWounded and suffers more non-aggravated damage, hemay still soak with his full Stamina (plus Fortitude, if hehas it). The health level penalties do apply to damagerolls for Strength-based attacks, but not for mechanicalweapons like firearms. Ultimately, this rule must be adjudicated by the Storyteller and common sense.
