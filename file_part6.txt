#### Knowledges

Knowledges involve the application of the mind, notthe body. Consequently, Knowledge Abilities are mostoften paired with Mental Traits. (It‚Äôs possible to rollCharisma + Academics, or even Stamina + Medicine,but such things are pretty rare.) The following descriptions speak of Knowledge levels in collegiate terms,although formal schooling is just one way to improvea Knowledge. Indeed, Knowledges can be self-taught,and the World of Darkness is home to any number ofautodidacts.If you don‚Äôt have any dots in a Knowledge, you cannoteven attempt a roll involving it unless the Storytellergives explicit permission (such as where common triviais concerned). If you don‚Äôt know Spanish, you can‚Äôt tryholding a conversation en espa√±ol on your wits alone.



--Academics

#########################################################################################################################################################################################################################################################

--Allies

	*Allies are mortals who support and help you ‚Äî family, friends, or even a mortal organization that owes yousome loyalty. Although allies aid you willingly, without coaxing or coercion, they are not always availableto offer assistance; they have their own concerns andcan do only so much for the sake of your relationship.However, they might have some useful BackgroundTraits of their own, and could provide you with indirect access to their contacts, influence, or resources.Allies are typically persons of influence and powerin your home city. They can be of almost any sort, depending on what your Storyteller will allow. You mayhave friends in the precinct morgue, at a prominentblog, among the high society of local celebrities, or ata construction site. Your Allies might be a clan of nomads who move their mobile home camp around thearea, or they might be a family of generations of policeofficers. You may even count the mayor himself amongyour friends, depending on how many dots you spen
don this Trait. Your Allies are generally trustworthy(though they probably don‚Äôt know that you‚Äôre a vampire, or even that vampires exist). However, nothingcomes for free. If you wind up drawing favors from yourfriend in the Cosa Nostra, he‚Äôll probably ask you to dohim a favor in kind in the future. This often leads tothe beginning of a story.‚Ä¶Allies may be pooled among a coterie of characters.

	1:One ally of moderate influence andpower

	2:Two allies, both of moderate power

	3:Three allies, one of whom is quiteinfluential

	4:Four allies, one of whom is veryinfluential

	5:Five allies, one of whom is extremelyinfluential



--Alternate Identity

	*You maintain an alternate identity, complete withpapers, birth certificates, or any other documentationyou desire. Only a few may know your real name oridentity. Your alternate persona may be highly involved in organized crime, a member of the oppositeSect, a con artist who uses alternate identities for hergame, or you may simply gather information about theenemy. Indeed, some vampires may know you as one individual while others believe you to be someone elseentirely.

	1:You are new at this identity game.Sometimes you slip and forget yourother persona.

	2:You are well grounded in youralternate identity. You areconvincing enough to play the partof a doctor, lawyer, funeral salesman,drug-smuggler, or a capable spy.

	3:You have a fair reputation as youralternate persona and get name-recognition in the area where youhave infiltrated.

	4:Your alternate identity has respectand trust within your area ofinfiltration.

	5:You command respect in your area ofinfiltration, and you may even haveaccumulated a bit of influence. Youhave the trust (or at least therecognition) of many powerfulindividuals within your area.



--Black Hand Membership

	*This Background is for Sabbat characters only.You are a member of the feared Black Hand, thebody of soldiers and assassins that serves the Sabbatfervently. Having this Background indicates that youare a full-fledged member of the organization, and youhave all the responsibilities and benefits that accompany membership.You may call upon members of the Black Hand toaid you, should you ever need it. Of course, this ability is a two-way street, and other Hand members maycall upon you to aid them. Thus, you may find yourselfassigned to perform assassinations, lend martial aid, oreven further the political ends of the Hand as a diplomat or spy. You may also be required to attend crusadesthat take you away from your pack. All members of theBlack Hand must heed the call of another Hand member, especially the superiors of the faction.Being a member of the Black Hand is a prestigiousmatter, and other members of the Sabbat respect theorganization. When dealing with other Sabbat, shouldyou choo
se to reveal your affiliation with the Hand,you may add your rating in this Background to anySocial dice pools, even after Status or other Abilities have been taken into account. Most Hand members,however, choose not to reveal their allegiance. TheBlack Hand is also remarkably adept at hunting downSabbat who claim membership in the Sect but do nottruly belong ‚Äî liars, beware. office, while your minor contacts might include beatcops, DMV clerks, club bouncers, or members of anonline social network. You don‚Äôt need to detail thesevarious ‚Äúpassing acquaintances‚Äù before play. Instead,to successfully get in touch with a minor contact, youshould roll your Contacts rating (difficulty 7). You canreach one minor contact for each success. Of course,you still have to convince them to give you the information you need, assuming they can get it.

	1:You are a grunt; you may call uponone Black Hand member once perstory.

	2:You are known and respected in theBlack Hand; you may call upon twoBlack Hand members once per story.

	3:You are held in the Black Hand‚Äôsregard; you may call upon five BlackHand members once per story.

	4:You are a hero among members ofthe Black Hand; you may call uponseven Black Hand members twice perstory (but you‚Äôd better have just cause‚Äî if it seems you‚Äôre becomingsoft, you may lose points in thisBackground). You may also lead largenumbers of Hand members into actionshould it ever become necessary.

	5:You are part of Black Hand legend;you may call upon 12 Black Handmembers twice per story (but see thepreceding caution). You may also leadlarge numbers of Hand members intoaction should it ever becomenecessary. The Seraphim may evenseek your counsel on matters ofimport.



--Contacts

	*You know people all over the city. When you startmaking phone calls around your network, the amountof information you can dig up is impressive. Ratherthan friends you can rely on to help you, like Allies,Contacts are largely people whom you can bribe, manipulate, or coerce into offering information. You alsohave a few major Contacts ‚Äî associates who can giveyou accurate information in their fields of expertise.You should describe each major contact in some detailbefore the game begins.In addition to your major contacts, you also have anumber of minor contacts spread throughout the city.Your major contact might be in the district attorney‚Äôs. Contacts may be pooled within the characters‚Äô coterie.

	1:One major contact

	2:Two major contact

	3:Three major contact

	4:Four major contact

	5:Five major contact



--Domain

	*Domain is physical territory (usually within thechronicle‚Äôs central city) to which your character controls access for the purpose of feeding. Some Kindredrefer to their domain as hunting grounds, and mostjealously guard their domains, even invoking the Tradition of the same name to protect their claims. Aspart of this Background, the character‚Äôs claim to thedomain is recognized by the Prince or some other Kindred authority in the city where it is located.The Kindred who claims the domain can‚Äôt keep theliving inhabitants from going about their business,nor does she exercise any direct influence over them,but she can keep watch herself and mind their comings and goings. She can also have Allies or Retainersspecifically look for unfamiliar vampires and alert herwhen they find some.Domain refers specifically to the geography (in mostcases a neighborhood or street) and properties on it,as opposed to the people who may dwell there (whichis the emphasis of Herd). Domain plays an impo
rtantpart in Kindred society ‚Äî vampires who lack significant Domain seldom earn respect ‚Äî but it isn‚Äôt an automatic entitlement to status among the Damned.You may designate one or more dots in Domain toincrease the security of your character‚Äôs territory ratherthan its size. Each dot so assigned to security providesa +1 difficulty penalty to efforts to intrude into the domain by anyone your character hasn‚Äôt specifically al- lowed in, and a -1 difficulty bonus to efforts by yourcharacter to identify and track intruders in the domain.A Domain of one dot‚Äôs size and two dots‚Äô security, forinstance, is small but quite resistant to intrusion, as opposed to a Domain rating of three dots‚Äô size with noextraordinary security.Each level of Domain reduces the difficulty of hunting checks by one for your character and those whomthe character allows in. It also adds to your starting (notmaximum) blood pool. If you use the domain securityoption, each dot of domain security raises the 
difficultyof hunting checks by one for uninvited vampires. Seep. 259 for more information on hunting.Domain (both size and security) can be used withpooled Background points.

	1:A single small building, such as asingle-family home or a socialestablishment ‚Äî enough for a basichaven.

	2:A church, factory, warehouse,mid-rise, or other large structure ‚Äîa location with ready but easilycontrollable access to the outsideworld.

	3:A high-rise, city block, or animportant intersection ‚Äî alocation or area that offers areas forconcealment as well as controlledaccess.

	4:A sewer subsection, a network ofservice tunnels, the enclave of homeson a hill overlooking the city ‚Äîa place with inherently protectivefeatures, such as an isolated mountainroad, bridge-only access, or vigilantprivate security force.

	5:An entire neighborhood, an ethnicsubdivision like ‚ÄúChinatown‚Äù or‚ÄúLittle Italy,‚Äù or a whole suburb.

	As noted previously, characters in a coterie canshare their domain resources for better results. Six toeight dots secure all of a small town or a distinct cityregion as a domain. Ten to 15 dots secure an importantbut not geographically huge city sector, such as ‚Äúthedocks,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHighland Park.‚Äù A large city itself mightbe a hundred-plus Domain points, as with Atlanta,Dallas, Geneva, or Baghdad. A city such as New York,London, Paris, Rome, Sao Paolo, or Shanghai wouldrequire many hundreds of Domain points.



--Fame

	*You enjoy widespread recognition in mortal society,perhaps as an entertainer, writer, or athlete. Peoplemay enjoy just being seen with you. This gives you allmanner of privileges when moving in mortal society,but can also attract an unwanted amount of attentionnow that you‚Äôre no longer alive. The greatest weaponfame has to offer is the ability to sway public opinion ‚Äî as modern media constantly proves. Fame isn‚Äôtalways tied to entertainment: A heinous criminal ina high-profile trial probably has a certain amount offame, as do a lawmaker and a scientist who has made apopularized discovery. This Background is obviously a mixed blessing. Youcan certainly enjoy the privileges of your prestige ‚Äîgetting the best seats, being invited to events you‚Äôdotherwise miss, getting appointments with the elite‚Äî but you‚Äôre sometimes recognized when you‚Äôd rathernot be. However, your enemies can‚Äôt just make you disappear without causing an undue stir, and you find itmuch easier to hunt
 in populated areas as people flockto you (reduce the difficulties of hunting rolls by onefor each dot in Fame). Additionally, your Storytellermight permit you to reduce difficulties of certain Socialrolls against particularly star-struck or impressionablepeople.

	1:You‚Äôre known to a select subculture‚Äî local club-goers, industry bloggers,or the Park Avenue set, for instance.	

	2:Random people start to recognizeyour face; you‚Äôre a minor celebritysuch as a small-time criminal or alocal news anchor.

	3:You have greater renown; perhapsyou‚Äôre a senator or an entertainer whoregularly gets hundreds of thousandsof YouTube hits.

	4:A full-blown celebrity; your name isoften recognized by the averageperson on the street.

	5:You‚Äôre a household word. Peoplename their children after you.



--Generation

	*This Background represents your Generation: thepurity of your blood, and your proximity to the FirstVampire. A high Generation rating may representa powerful sire or a decidedly dangerous taste for diablerie. If you don‚Äôt take any dots in this Trait, youbegin play as a Thirteenth Generation vampire. Seep. 270 for further information.

	1:Twelfth Generation: 11 blood pool,can spend 1 blood point per turn

	2:Eleventh Generation: 12 blood pool,can spend 1 blood point per turn

	3:Tenth Generation: 13 blood pool,can spend 1 blood point per turn

	4:Ninth Generation: 14 blood pool,can spend 2 blood points per turn

	5:Eighth Generation: 15 blood pool,can spend 3 blood points per turn



--Herd

	*You have built a group of mortals from whom you canfeed without fear. A herd may take many forms, fromcircles of kinky clubgoers to actual cults built aroundyou as a god-figure. In addition to providing nourishment, your herd might come in handy for minor tasks,though they are typically not very controllable, closelyconnected to you, or particularly skilled (for more effective pawns, purchase Allies or Retainers). YourHerd rating adds dice to your rolls for hunting; seep. 259 for further details.Players may purchase pooled Herd with Backgroundpoints.

	1:Three vessels

	2:Seven vessels

	3:15 vessels

	4:30 vessels

	5:60 vessels



--Influence

	*You have pull in the mortal community, whetherthrough wealth, prestige, political office, blackmail, orsupernatural manipulation. Kindred with high Influence can sway, and in rare cases even control, the political and social processes of human society. Influencerepresents the sum of your opinion- or policy-swayingpower in your community, particularly among the police and bureaucracy. In some cases, cultivating Influence is a path to generating Resources (see below). age, which can lead to a number of interesting stories.A mentor typically remains aloof, giving you useful information or advice out of camaraderie, but will abandon you without a thought if you prove an unworthy ortroublesome prot√©g√©. Some rolls may require you to use Influence in placeof an Ability, particularly when attempting to sway minor bureaucrats. It‚Äôs easier to institute sweeping changes on a local level than a worldwide scale (e.g., havingan ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù building demolished is relatively easy,while star
ting a war is a bit more difficult). Influence can be used with pooled Backgroundpoints.

	1:Moderately influential; a factor in citypolitics

	2:Well-connected; a force in statepolitics

	3:Position of influence; a factor inregional politics

	4:Broad personal power; a force innational politics

	5:Vastly influential; a factor in globalpolitics



--Mentor

	*This Trait represents a Kindred or group of Kindredwho looks out for you, offering guidance or aid once ina while. A mentor may be powerful, but his power neednot be direct. Depending on the number of dots in thisBackground, your mentor might be nothing more thana vampire with a remarkable information network, ormight be a centuries-old creature with tremendous influence and supernatural power. He may offer advice,speak to the Prince or Archbishop on your behalf,steer other elders clear of you, or warn you when you‚Äôrewalking into situations you don‚Äôt understand.Most often your mentor is your sire, but it could wellbe any Cainite with an interest in your wellbeing. Ahigh Mentor rating could even represent a group oflike-minded vampires, such as the elders of the city‚ÄôsTremere chantry or a Black Hand cell.Bear in mind that this Trait isn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúGet out of JailFree‚Äù card. Your mentor won‚Äôt necessarily arrive likethe cavalry whenever you‚Äôre endangered (and if shedoes, you‚
Äôre likely to lose a dot or more in this Background after rousing her ire). What‚Äôs more, she mightoccasionally expect something in return for her patron-

	1:Mentor is an ancilla of littleinfluence, or a Ductus or Pack Priest.

	2:Mentor is respected: an elder orhighly-decorated veteran,for instance.

	3:Mentor is heavily influential, such asa member of the Primogen ora Bishop.

	4:Mentor has a great deal of power overthe city: a Prince or Archbishop,for example.

	5:Mentor is extraordinarily powerful,perhaps even a Justicar or Cardinal.



--Resources

	*Resources are valuable goods whose disposition yourcharacter controls. These assets may be actual cash,but as this Background increases, they‚Äôre more likelyto be investments, property, or earning capital of somesort ‚Äî land, industrial assets, stocks and bonds, commercial inventories, criminal infrastructure, contraband, even taxes or tithes. Remember that vampiresdon‚Äôt need to arrange for any food except blood andtheir actual needs (as opposed to wants) for shelter arevery easily accommodated. Resources for vampires gomostly to pay for luxuries and the associated expensesof developing and maintaining Status, Influence, andother Backgrounds. A character with no dots in Resources may have enough clothing and supplies to getby, or she may be destitute and squatting in a refrigerator box under an overpass.You receive a basic allowance each month based onyour rating, so be certain to detail exactly where thismoney comes from, be it a job, trust fund or dividends.(Storytellers, deci
de for your locality and any relevanttime period what an appropriate amount of cash thismonthly allowance is.) After all, a Kindred‚Äôs fortunemay well run out over the course of the chronicle, depending on how well he maintains it. You can also sellyour less liquid resources if you need the cash, but thiscan take weeks or even months, depending on whatexactly you‚Äôre trying to sell. Art buyers don‚Äôt just popout of the woodwork, after all.Players may purchase Resources for their characterswith pooled Background points.

	1:Sufficient. You can maintain a typicalresidence in the style of the workingclass with stability, even if spendingsprees come seldom.

	2:Moderate. You can display yourselfas a member in good standing of themiddle class, with the occasional giftand indulgence seemly for a personof even higher station. You canmaintain a servant or hire specifichelp as necessary. A fraction of yourresources are available in cash,readily portable property (like jewelryor furniture), and other valuables(such as a car or modest home) thatlet you maintain a standard of livingat the one-dot level wherever youhappen to be, for up to six months.

	3:Comfortable. You are a prominentand established member of yourcommunity, with land and an owneddwelling, and you have a reputationthat lets you draw on credit at verygenerous terms. You likely have moretied up in equity and property thanyou do in ready cash. You canmaintain a one-dot quality ofexistence wherever you are withoutdifficulty, for as long as you choose.

	4:Wealthy. You rarely touch cash, asmost of your assets exist in tangibleforms that are themselves morevaluable and stable than papermoney. You hold more wealth thanmany of your local peers (if they canbe called such a thing). Whenearning your Resources doesn‚Äôtenjoy your usual degree of attention,you can maintain a three-dotexistence for up to a year, and a twodot existence indefinitely.

	5:Extremely Wealthy. You are themodel to which others strive toachieve, at least in the popular mind.Television shows, magazine spreads,and gossip websites speculate aboutyour clothing, the appointments ofyour numerous homes, and the luxury of your modes of transportation. Youhave vast and widely distributedassets, perhaps tied to the fates ofnations, each with huge staffs andconnections to every level ofsociety through a region. Youtravel with a minimum of three-dotcomforts, more with a little effort.Corporations and governmentssometimes come to you to buy intostocks or bond programs.



--Retainers

	*Not precisely Allies or Contacts, your retainers are servants, assistants, or other people who are your loyal andsteadfast companions. Many vampires‚Äô servants are ghouls(p. 496) ‚Äî their supernatural powers and blood bond-enforced loyalty make them the servants of choice. Retainersmay also be people whom you‚Äôve repeatedly Dominateduntil they have no free will left, or followers so enthralledwith your Presence that their loyalty borders on blind fanaticism. Some vampires, particularly those with the Animalism Discipline, use animal ghouls as retainers.You must maintain some control over your retainers,whether through a salary, the gift of your vitae, or theuse of Disciplines. Retainers are never ‚Äúblindly loyal nomatter what‚Äù ‚Äî if you treat them poorly without exercising strict control, they might well turn on you.Retainers may be useful, but they should never beflawless. A physically powerful ghoul might be rebellious, inconveniently dull-witted, or lacking in practical sk
ills. A loyal manservant might be physically weakor possess no real personal initiative or creativity. ThisBackground isn‚Äôt an excuse to craft an unstoppablebodyguard or pet assassin ‚Äî it‚Äôs a method to bring morefully-developed characters into the chronicle, as wellas to reflect the followers for which the Kindred arenotorious. Generally, retainers are more like Renfieldthan Anita Blake. (If the player and Storyteller agree,a player may create a more competent single Retainerby combining more points in this Background, puttingmore eggs in one basket, as the saying goes.)Players can spend pooled Background points on Retainers.

	1:One retainer

	2:Two retainers

	3:Three retainers

	4:Four retainers

	5:Five retainers



--Rituals

	*This Background is for Sabbat characters only. You know the ritae and rituals of the Sabbat, and youcan enact many of them. This Background is vital to being a Pack Priest ‚Äî without this Background, ritae willnot function. This Background is actually a supernaturalinvestment, drawing on the magic of the eldest Tzimiscesorcerers. Sabbat vampires who are not their pack‚Äòspriests should have an outstanding reason for acquiringthis Background, as Pack Priests are loath to share theirsecrets with more secular members of the Sect. Someexample rituals include the Vaulderie (p. 288), as wellas those presented in the Appendix (p. 507).

--Status

	*You have something of a reputation and standing(earned or unearned) within the local community ofKindred. Status among Camarilla society is as oftenderived from your sire‚Äôs status and the respect due yourparticular bloodline as it is by personal achievement.Among the Sabbat, status is more likely to stem fromthe reputation of your pack or the zeal of your outlook.Elders are known for having little respect for their juniors; this Background can mitigate that somewhat.High status within the Camarilla does not transfer toSabbat society (and will most likely make you a notorious target for your Sect‚Äôs rivals), and vice versa. Similarly, Autarkis generally have zero Status, unless theyhave somehow garnered so much power and attentionthat they are considered forces to be reckoned with.You may have occasion to roll your Status in conjunction with a Social Trait; this reflects the positive effectsof your prestige.Note that Caitiff characters may not purchase Statusduring character creat
ion. Caitiff are the lowest of thelow, and any respect they achieve must be earned during the course of the chronicle.
