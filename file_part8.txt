#### Disciplines



--Animalism

	*The Beast resides within all creatures, from scuttling cockroaches to scabrous rats up through untamedwolves and even powerful Kindred elders. Animalismallows the vampire to amplify his intensely primordialnature. He can not only communicate with animals,but can also force his will upon them, directing suchbeasts to do as he commands. As the vampire grows inpower, he can even control the Beast within mortalsand other supernaturals.Beasts grow distinctly agitated in the presence of avampire who lacks this Discipline or the Skill of Animal Ken, often to the point of attacking or runningfrom the vampire. In contrast, vampires possessingAnimalism exude a dominant vibe to lower creatures,which attracts them.Animalism is commonly found with vampires of theGangrel and Nosferatu Clans. Manipulation and Charisma are important for the use of Animalism powers;the stronger the vampire’s personality, the more influence he has over animals.Storytelling Animals It can be difficult for the Storyt
eller to useanimals as something more than a plot devicewhenever a character tries to communicatewith them. It’s easy to fall back on monosyllabic speech and easily led creatures in orderto get the story moving along. And indeed,animals are simpler than humans – they focuson the present and are directed by instinctsinstead of complex goals and elaborateschemes. However, simple doesn’t necessarily mean stupid; animals need cunning andperception to survive, and both can be ofgreat use to a vampire master. Storytellers canmake animals dynamic, interesting charactersthat bring a lot to the chronicle, or they canquickly gloss over the finer points of theircharacterization to get back to the more pressing conflicts in the chronicle.Statistics for certain animals are found inChapter Nine, p. 388.

	1:Feral Whispers

	*This power is the basis from which all other Animalism abilities grow. The vampire creates an empathicconnection with a beast, thereby allowing him to communicate or issue simple commands. The Kindred lockseyes with the animal, transmitting his desires throughsheer force of will. Although it isn’t necessary to actually “speak” in chirps, hisses, or barks, some vampiresfind that doing so helps strengthen the connectionwith the animal. Eye contact must be maintained theentire time; if it’s broken, the Kindred must re-establish contact to continue communication.The simpler the creature, the more difficult it becomes to connect with the animal’s Beast. Mammals,predatory birds, and larger reptiles are relatively easyto communicate with. Insects, invertebrates, and mostfish are just too simple to connect with.Feral Whispers provides no guarantees that an animalwill want to deal with the vampire, nor does it ensurethat the animal will pursue any requests the vampiremakes of it. S
till, it does at least make the creature better disposed toward the Kindred. The manner in whichthe vampire presents his desires to the animal often de- pends on the type of creature. A Kindred can often bullysmaller beasts into heeding commands, but he’s betteroff couching orders for large predators as requests.If the vampire successfully uses the power, the animal performs the command to the best of its ability andintellect. Only the very brightest creatures understandtruly complex directives (orders dealing with conditional situations or requiring abstract logic). Commands that the animal does understand remain deeplyimplanted, however, and guide its behavior for sometime.System: No roll is necessary to talk with an animal, but the character must establish eye contact (seep. 152) first. Issuing commands requires a Manipulation + Animal Ken roll. The difficulty depends on thecreature: Predatory mammals (wolves, cats, vampirebats) are difficulty 6, other mammals and predatorybirds 
(rats, owls) are difficulty 7, and other birds andreptiles (pigeons, snakes) are difficulty 8. This difficultyis reduced by one if the character speaks to the animalin its “native tongue,” and can be adjusted further bycircumstances and roleplaying skill (we highly recommend that all communication between characters andanimals be roleplayed). The number of successes the player achieves dictateshow strongly the character’s command affects the animal. One success is sufficient to have a cat follow anindividual and lead the character to the same location,three successes are enough to have a raven spy on atarget for weeks, and five successes ensure that a grizzlyferociously guards the entrance to the character’s wilderness haven for some months.The character’s Nature plays a large part in how heapproaches these conversations. The character mighttry intimidating, teasing, cajoling, or rationalizing. Theplayer should understand that he does not simply playhis character in these si
tuations, but the Beast Withinas well.Using this power cannot force an animal to do something against its nature, or to force a creature to riskits life. While the aforementioned grizzly would standguard to the vampire’s haven and even fight for it, itwould not do so against obviously superior numbers orsomething overwhelmingly supernatural. A predatorybird might be convinced to harry a target, but woulddefinitely not hold ground. A docile dog or skittish catwould have no problem with reporting something ithad seen, but it wouldn’t enter combat unless given noother option — though it would likely agree to standand fight and then flee at the first opportunity, if aharsh Kindred demanded it.

	2:Beckoning

	*The vampire’s connection to the Beast grows strongenough that he may call out in the voice of a specifictype of animal — howling like a wolf, shrilling like araven, etc. This call mystically summons creatures ofthe chosen type. Since each type of animal has a different call, Beckoning works for only a single speciesat a time.All such animals within earshot are summoned, andsome percentage of them will heed the Beckoning if itis successful. While the vampire has no further controlover the beasts who answer, the animals who do arefavorably disposed toward him and are at least willingto listen to the Kindred’s concerns. (The vampire canthen use Feral Whispers on individual animals to command them, which may be at a decreased difficulty atStoryteller discretion.)System: The player rolls Charisma + Survival (difficulty 6) to determine the response to the character’scall; consult the table below. Only animals that can hear the cry will respond. If the Storyteller decides noanimals
 of that type are within earshot, the summonsgoes unanswered.The call can be as specific as the player desires. Acharacter could call for all bats in the area, for only themale bats nearby, or for only the albino bat with thenotched ear he saw the other night.

		@1 success	A single animal responds.

		@2 successes	One-quarter of the animals withinearshot respond.

		@3 successes	Half of the animals respond.

		@4 successes	Most of the animals respond.

		@5 successes	All of the animals respond.

	3:Quell the Beast

	*As the supreme predators of the natural world, Kindred are highly attuned to the bestial nature that dwellswithin every mortal heart. A vampire who developsthis power may assert his will over a mortal (animal orhuman) subject, subduing the Beast within her. Thisquenches all powerful, strong emotions — hope, fury,love, fear — within the target. The Kindred must either touch his subject or stare into her eyes to channelhis will effectively.Mortals who lack the fire of their inner Beasts arequite tractable, reacting to even stressful situationswith indifference. Even the most courageous or maddened mortal becomes apathetic and listless, while anespecially sensitive individual may suffer from a phobicderangement while under the power’s influence.Different Clans evoke this power in different ways,though the effect itself is identical. Tzimisce call itCowing the Beast, since they force the mortal’s weakerspirit to shrivel in fear before the Kindred’s own innerBeast. Nosferatu re
fer to it as Song of Serenity, sincethey soothe the subject’s Beast into a state of uttercomplacency, thus allowing them to feed freely. Gangrel know the power as Quell the Beast, and force themortal spirit into a state of fear or apathy as befits theindividual vampire’s nature.System: The player rolls Manipulation + Intimidation if forcing down the Beast through fear, or Manipulation + Empathy if soothing it into complacency. The difficulty of the roll is 7 in either case. This is an extended action requiring as many total successes as thetarget has Willpower. Failure indicates that the playermust start over from the beginning, while a botch indicates that the vampire may not affect that subject’sBeast for the remainder of the scene.When a mortal’s Beast is cowed or soothed, she canno longer use or regain Willpower. She ceases all struggles, whether mental or physical. She doesn’t evendefend herself if assaulted, though the Storyteller mayallow a Willpower roll if the morta
l believes her life istruly threatened. To recover from this power, the mortal’s player rolls Willpower (difficulty 6) once per dayuntil she accumulates enough successes to equal thevampire’s Willpower. Kindred cannot be affected bythis power.Though a vampire’s Beast cannot be cowed with thisability, the Storyteller may allow characters to use the“soothing” variation of this power to pull a vampire outof frenzy. With three or more successes, the frenzyingvampire may roll again to pull herself out of frenzy, using the same difficulty as the stimulus that caused thefrenzy originally.

	4:Subsume the Spirit

	*By locking his gaze with that of an animal, the vampire may mentally possess the creature. Some elders believe that since animals don’t have souls but spirits, thevampire can move his own soul into the animal’s body.Many younger vampires think it a matter of transferring one’s consciousness into the animal’s mind. In either case, it’s agreed that the beast’s weaker spirit (ormind) is pushed aside by the Kindred’s own consciousness. The vampire’s body falls into a motionless stateakin to torpor while his mind takes control of the animal’s actions, remaining this way until the Kindred’sconsciousness returns.Some haughty Tzimisce eschew this power, considering it debasing to enter the body of a lesser creature.When they do stoop to using it, they possess only predators. Conversely, Gangrel revel in connecting to thenatural world in this way. They delight in sampling different animals’ natures.System: The player rolls Manipulation + AnimalKen (difficulty 8) as the 
character looks into the animal’s eyes (see sidebar on p. 152). The number of successes allows the character to employ some mental Disciplines while possessing the animal, as noted below.

		@1 success 	Cannot use Disciplines

		@2 successes	Can use Auspex and other sensorypowers

		@3 successes	Can also use Presence and otherpowers of emotional manipulation

		@4 successes	Can also use Dementation,Dominate, and other powers ofmental manipulation

		@5 successes	Can also use Chimerstry,Necromancy, Thaumaturgy, andother mystical powers

	**This power entwines the character’s consciousnessclosely with the animal’s spirit, so much so that thecharacter may continue to think and feel like that animal even after breaking the connection. This effectcontinues until the character spends a total of sevennights or three Willpower points to resist and finallyovercome the animal nature. This should be roleplayed, though the character will be affected to a lesserdegree if the player chooses to spend Willpower.At the end of any particularly exciting incident during possession, the player rolls Wits + Empathy (difficulty 8) for the character to retain his own mind. Failure indicates that the character’s mind returns to hisown body, but still thinks in purely animalistic terms.A botch returns the character to his body, and alsosends him into frenzy.The character may travel as far from his own physicalbody as he chooses while possessing the animal. Thecharacter retains no conscious connection with hisvampire body during this ti
me, though. The vampiremay also venture out during the day, albeit in the animal’s body. However, the character’s own body mustbe awake to do so, requiring a successful roll to remainawake (see p. 262). If the character leaves the animal’sbody (by choice, if his body falls asleep, or after sustaining significant injury), the vampire’s consciousnessreturns to his physical form instantaneously.Although the vampire has no conscious link to hisbody while possessing the animal, he does form a sympathetic bond. Anything the animal feels, the vampirealso experiences, from pleasure to pain. In fact, anydamage the animal’s body sustains is also applied to thecharacter’s body, though the Kindred body may soakas normal. If the animal dies before the vampire’s soulcan flee from the body, the character’s body falls into torpor. Presumably this is in sympathetic response tothe massive trauma of death, but some Kindred believethat the vampire’s soul is cast adrift during this timea
nd must find its way back to the body.



	5:Drawing Out the Beast

	*At this level of Animalism, the Kindred has a keenunderstanding of the Beast Within, and is able to release his feral urges upon another mortal or vampire.The recipient of the vampire’s Beast is instantly overcome by frenzy. This is an unnatural frenzy, however,as the victim is channeling the Kindred’s own fury. Assuch, the vampire’s own behavior, expressions, andeven speech patterns are evident in the subject’s savage actions.Gangrel and Tzimisce are especially fond of unleashing their Beasts onto others. Gangrel do so to stir theirghouls into inspired heights of savagery during combat.Tzimisce care less about who receives their Beast thanretaining their own composure.System: The player must announce his preferred target (since it must be someone within sight, DrawingOut the Beast cannot be used if the vampire is alone),then roll Manipulation + Self-Control/Instinct (difficulty 8). Refer to the table below for the results:

		@1 success	The character transfers the Beast, butunleashes it upon a randomindividual.

		@2 successes	The character is stunned by the effortand may not act next turn, buttransfers the Beast successfully.Alternatively, the character may actnormally during the turn, but mustspend a Willpower point or suffer asingle level of lethal damage.

		@3+ successes 	The character transfers the Beast successfully.

	**If the attempt fails, the character himself immediately enters frenzy. As the character relaxes in expectation of relieving his savage urges, the Beast takes thatopportunity to dig deeper. In this case, the frenzy laststwice as long as normal and is twice as difficult to shrugoff; its severity also increases exponentially. Botching this roll is even more catastrophic; the heightenedfrenzy grows so extreme that not even expending Will- power curbs its duration or effects. The character is ahapless victim to the terrible fury of his Beast, and maywell hurl herself into a savage, flesh-rending rampagethat leaves the Masquerade (and unfortunate nearbyonlookers) in tatters.If the character leaves the target’s presence beforethe frenzy expends itself, the vampire loses his Beast,perhaps permanently. While no longer vulnerable tofrenzy, the character cannot use or regain Willpowerand becomes increasingly lethargic. To recover theBeast, he must find the person who now possesses it(who li
kely isn’t enjoying herself very much) and coaxthe Beast into its proper vessel. The most effective wayto do so is to behave in ways that make the Beast wantto return — however, this isn’t a guarantee that it willwish to do so. Alternatively, the character can simplykill the host (thus causing the Beast to return to thevampire immediately).

	6: Animal Succulence

	*Most vampires find the blood of animals flat, tasteless, and lacking in nutritional value. Some Gangreland Nosferatu, however, have refined their understanding of the spirits of such “lesser prey” to the pointthat they are able to draw much more sustenance frombeasts than normal Kindred can. This power does notallow an elder to subsist solely on the blood of animals,but it does allow him to go for extended periods of timewithout taking vitae from humans or other Kindred.System: No roll is needed; once learned, this poweris always in effect. Animal Succulence allows a character to count each blood point drawn from an animal astwo in her blood pool. This does not increase the sizeof the vampire’s blood pool, just the nutritional valueof animal blood.Animal Succulence does not allow a character tocompletely ignore his craving for the blood of “higher”prey; in fact, it heightens his desire for “real food.” Every three times (rounded down) the character drinksfrom an animal
, a cumulative +1 difficulty is appliedto the next Self-Control/Instinct roll the player makeswhen the character is confronted with the possibilityof dining on human or Kindred blood.Animal Succulence does not increase the bloodpoint value of the blood of other supernatural creatures(Gangrel, werecreatures, and so on) who have takenanimal forms, nor does it change the vampire’s feedingpreferences (such as the Ventrue have).

	6: Shared Soul

	*This power allows a character to probe the mind ofany one animal she touches. Shared Soul can be verydisconcerting to both parties involved, as each participant is completely immersed in the thoughts andemotions of the other. With enough effort or time,each participant can gain a complete understanding ofthe other’s mind. Shared Soul is most often used toextract an animal’s memories of a specific event, butsome Gangrel use this power as a tool in the searchfor enlightenment, feeling they come to a better understanding of their own Beasts through rapport withtrue beasts. Too close of a bond, however, can leavethe two souls entangled after the sharing ends, causingthe vampire to adopt mannerisms, behavior patterns,or even ethics (or lack thereof) similar to those of theanimal.System: The character touches the intended subjectcreature, and the player rolls Perception + Animal Ken(difficulty 6). The player spends a Willpower point forevery turn past the first that contact is maintai
ned. Locating a specific memory takes six turns, minus one turnfor every success on the roll. A complete bond takes 10turns, minus one turn for every success on the roll. Abotch on this roll may, at the Storyteller’s discretion,send the vampire into a frenzy or give the character aderangement related to the behavior patterns of theanimal (extreme cowardice if the vampire contactedthe soul of mouse, bloodlust if the subject was a rabiddog, and so forth).••••• • Species SpeechThe basic power Feral Whispers (Animalism 1) allows character to communicate with only one animalat a time. With Species Speech, a character can enterinto psychic communion with all creatures of a certainspecies that are present. Species Speech is most oftenused after an application of The Beckoning (Animalism 2), which can draw a crowd of likely subjects.System: The player rolls Manipulation + AnimalKen (difficulty 7) to establish contact with the targeted group of animals. Once the character establi
shes contact, the player makes a second roll to issuecommands. There is no practical upper limit on thenumber of animals that can be commanded with thispower, although all of the intended subjects must be inthe vampire’s immediate vicinity. Only one species ofanimal can be commanded at a time; thus, if a character is standing in the middle of the reptile house at thezoo, she could command all of the Komodo dragons, all of the boa constrictors, or all of the skinks, but shecould not simultaneously give orders to every reptileor snake present. Species Speech functions much likeFeral Whispers in all other respects.Note: Players (and Storytellers) shouldn’t get toowrapped up in species differences like northern diamondback rattlesnakes and south-eastern diamondbackrattlesnakes. At Storyteller discretion, the expenditureof an additional Willpower point allows the character’scommands to extend to members of a similar species tothe one initially commanded.

	7: Conquer the Beast

	*Masters of Animalism have a much greater understanding of both beasts in general and the Beast inparticular. Those who have developed this power canmaster their own Beasts to a degree impossible for lesserKindred to attain. Conquer the Beast allows the vampire both to control her frenzies and to enter them atwill. Some elders say that the development of this power is one of the first steps on the road to Golconda.System: The character can enter frenzy at will. Theplayer rolls Willpower (difficulty 7). Success sends thecharacter into a controlled frenzy. He can choose histargets at will, but gains limited Dominate and woundpenalty resistance and Rötschreck immunity as per thenormal frenzy rules (p. 298). A botch on the roll sendsthe vampire into an uncontrolled frenzy which Conquer the Beast may not be used to end.The player may also roll Willpower (difficulty 9) toenable the character to control an involuntary frenzy.In this case, a Willpower point must be spent for every turn that
 the vampire remains in frenzy. The playermay make Self-Control/Instinct rolls as normal to end afrenzy, but if the vampire runs out of Willpower pointsbefore the frenzy ends, he drops into an uncontrolledfrenzy again. A botch on the Willpower roll raises thedifficulty of the vampire’s Self-Control/Instinct rolls bytwo and renders Conquer the Beast unusable for theremainder of the night.

	8: Taunt the Caged Beast

	*Some Kindred are so attuned to the Beast that theycan unleash it in another individual at will. Vampireswho have developed this power are able to send adversaries into frenzy with a finger’s touch and the resultant momentary contact with the victim’s Beast.The physical contact allows the vampire’s own Beastto reach out and awaken that of the victim, enraging itby threatening its territory.

	**System: The character touches the target. Theplayer spends a Willpower point and rolls Manipulation + Empathy (difficulty 7). The victim makes aSelf-Control/Instinct roll (difficulty 5 + the numberof successes); failure results in an immediate frenzy. Abotch causes the character to unleash his own Beastand frenzy instead. This power maybe used on thoseindividuals who are normally incapable of frenzy, sending ordinary humans into murderous rages worthy ofthe most bloodthirsty Brujah berserker.

	9:Unchain the Beast

	*The self-destructive nature of Cainites can be turnedagainst them by an elder who possesses this formidablepower. With a glance, the vampire can awaken theBeasts of her enemies, causing physical injury and excruciating agony as the victim’s own violent impulsesmanifest in physical form to tear him apart from within.A target of this power erupts into a fountain of bloodand gore as claw and bite wounds from an invisiblesource spontaneously tear his flesh asunder.System: The character makes eye contact (seep. 152) with the intended victim. The player spendsthree blood points and rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty of the victim’s Self-Control/Instinct +4). Each success inflicts one health level of aggravateddamage, which can be soaked normally. A botch inflicts one health level of lethal damage to the invokingcharacter for each “1” rolled. This damage can also besoaked normally.



--Auspex

	*Auspex gives the vampire uncanny sensory abilities.She starts with the capacity to heighten her naturalsenses significantly, but as she grows in power, she canperceive psychic auras and read the thoughts of anotherbeing. Auspex can also pierce through mental illusionssuch as those created by Obfuscate — see the sidebar“Seeing the Unseen” on p. 142 for more.However, a vampire with Auspex needs to be careful.Her increased sensory sensitivity can cause her to bedrawn in by beautiful things or stunned by loud noises or pungent smells. Sudden or dynamic events candisorient an Auspex-using character unless her playermakes a Willpower roll to block them out (difficulty ofat least 4, although the more potent the source of distraction, the higher the difficulty). Failure overwhelms the character’s senses, making her oblivious to her surroundings for a turn or two. While the Malkavians andToreador are more prone to these kinds of distractions,the Tremere and Tzimisce aren’t immune.D
ots in Perception are very useful for using Auspexpowers, as more successes help the character gain moresensory information.Condition		Aura Colors	Afraid			OrangeAggressive		PurpleAngry			RedBitter			BrownCalm			Light BlueCompassionate		PinkConservative		Lavender	Depressed		Gray		Desirous or Lustful	Deep RedDistrustful		Light GreenEnvious		Dark GreenExcited		VioletGenerous		RoseHappy			VermilionHateful		Black		Idealistic		YellowInnocent		WhiteLovestruck		BlueObsessed		GreenSad			Silver		Spiritual		Gold		Suspicious		Dark Blue	Anxious		Auras appear scrambled like static or white noiseConfused		Mottled, shifting colorsDiablerist		Black veins in auraDaydreaming		Sharp flickering colorsFrenzied		Rapidly rippling colorsPsychotic		Hypnotic, swirling colorsVampire		Aura colors are paleGhoul			Pale blotches in the auraMagic Use		Myriad sparkles in auraWerebeast		Bright, vibrant auraGhost			Weak, intermittent auraFaerie			Rainbow highlights in auraAuspex Rating		No. of Targets			No. of TargetsA

	1:Heightened Senses This power increases the acuity of all of the vampire’s senses, effectively doubling the clarity and rangeof sight, hearing, and smell. While her senses of tasteand touch extend no farther than normal, they likewise become far more distinct; the vampire could tastethe hint of liquor in a victim’s blood or feel the give ofthe board concealing a hollow space in the floor. TheKindred may magnify her senses at will, sustaining thisheightened focus for as long as she desires. At the Storyteller’s option, this may make hunting easier.Occasionally, this talent provides extrasensory oreven precognitive insights. These brief, unfocusedglimpses may be odd premonitions, flashes of empathy,or eerie feelings of foreboding. The vampire has nocontrol over these perceptions, but with practice canlearn to interpret them with a fair degree of accuracy.Expanded senses come at a price, however. Brightlights, loud noises and strong smells present a hazardwhile the vampire uses t
his power. In addition to thepossibility for distraction, an especially sudden or potent stimulus (like the glare of a spotlight or a clap ofthunder) can blind or deafen the Kindred for an houror more.System: It takes a reflexive action to activate thisability, but no roll or other cost is required. In certaincircumstances, dice rolls associated with using thecharacter’s sense (such as Perception + Alertness) decrease in difficulty by a number equal to the character’sAuspex rating when the power is engaged.The Storyteller may also use this power to see if thecharacter perceives a threat. In this case, the Storyteller privately rolls the character’s unmodified Auspexrating, applying whatever difficulty he feels best suitsthe circumstances. For example, sensing that a pistol ispointed at the back of the character’s head may requirea roll of difficulty 5, while the sudden realization thata rival for Primogen is planning her assassination mayrequire a 9. Note that even this “pre
cognition” comesonly as a result of interpreting details the Kindred is able to notice. It’s not an all-purpose insight or miraculous revelation.At the character’s discretion, she may selectivelyheighten one specific sense, rather than leaving themall on. In these cases, the difficulty to perceive stimuli using that sense drops by one, but the difficulty toavoid distraction or temporary bedazzlement increasesby one.This power does not let characters see in pitch darkness, as does Eyes of the Beast (p. 199), but it does reduce difficulty penalties to act in such darkness from+2 to +1, and the character may make ranged attacksin pitch darkness if she can hear, smell, or otherwisedetect her foe.

	2:Aura Perception

	*Using this power, the vampire can perceive the psychic “auras” that radiate from mortals and supernaturalbeings alike. These halos comprise a shifting series ofcolors that take practice to discern with clarity. Eventhe simplest individual has many shifting hues withinhis aura; strong emotions predominate, while momentary impressions or deep secrets flash through in streaksand swirls.

	**The colors change in sympathy with the subject’semotional state, blending into new tones in a constantly dancing pattern. The stronger the emotionsinvolved, the more intense the hues become. A skilledvampire can learn much from her subject by readingthe nuances of color and brilliance in the aura’s flow.Aside from perceiving emotional states, vampires useAura Perception to detect supernatural beings. Thecolors in Kindred auras, while intense, are quite pale;mage halos often flare and crackle with arcane power;the race of shapeshifters has strikingly bright, almostfrantic, auras; ghosts have weak auras that flicker fitfully like a dying flame; and faerie creatures’ radiance isshot through with capricious rainbow hues.System: After the character stares at the subject forat least a few seconds, the player rolls Perception + Empathy (difficulty 8); each success indicates how muchof the subject’s aura the character sees and understands(see the table below). A failure indicates t
hat the playof colors and patterns yields no prevailing impression.A botch indicates a false or erroneous interpretation.The Storyteller may wish to make this roll, thus keeping the player in the dark as to the veracity of the character’s interpretation.

		@1 success	Can distinguish only the shade (paleor bright).

		@2 successes	Can distinguish the main color.

		@3 successes	Can recognize the color patterns.

		@4 successes	Can detect subtle shifts.

		@5 successes	Can identify mixtures of color andpattern.

	**The Aura Colors chart offers some example ideasof common colors and the emotions they reflect thatStorytellers can use. Note that it is nearly impossibleto determine with certainty if a particular character islying or not with this power – vampires are inherentlydeceitful by nature, but even mortals might react withanxiety to questions while still being truthful. It is,however, helpful in determine the target’s emotionalstate, which might lead the vampire to decide that aparticular target is suspicious.A character may choose to perform a very cursoryaura scan of a large area like a nightclub’s dance flooror the audience in a gallery. In this case, the playerdecides which characteristic of auras she’s looking for,and that’s the only information she’s able to glean ifthe roll is successful. (At the Storyteller’s discretion,on this general scan roll, more successes on the rollmay more quickly yield what the character seeks.) Forexample, the player may specify, “Who’s
 the most nervous person in attendance?” or “Are there any vampirically pale auras among the CEO’s entourage?” Thereafter, the player may narrow down her scrutiny of asingle individual, with an additional roll as normal.The character may focus in on a particular subject’saura only once per scene with any degree of clarity.Any subsequent attempts that result in failure shouldbe considered botches. It is very easy for the characterto imagine seeing what she wants to see when judging someone’s intentions. After 24 hours, the charactermay try again at no penalty.It is possible, though difficult, to sense the aura of abeing who is otherwise invisible to normal sight. Referto “Seeing the Unseen,” p. 142, for more information.

	3:The Spirit’s Touch

	*When someone handles an object for any lengthof time, he leaves a psychic impression on the item.A vampire with this level of Auspex can “read” thesesensations, learning who handled the object, when helast held it, and what was done with it recently. (For these purposes, a corpse counts as an “object” and canbe read accordingly.) These visions are seldom clearand detailed, registering more like a kind of “psychicsnapshot.” Still, the Kindred can learn much evenfrom such a glimpse. Although most visions concernthe last person to handle the item, a long-time ownerleaves a stronger impression than someone who heldthe object briefly.Gleaning information from the spiritual residue requires the vampire to hold the object and enter a shallow trance. She is only marginally aware of her surroundings while using The Spirit’s Touch, but a loudnoise or jarring physical sensation breaks the tranceinstantly.System: The player rolls Perception + Empathy. Thedifficulty is determined b
y the age of the impressionsand the mental and spiritual strength of the person orevent that left them. Sensing information from a pistol used for a murder hours ago may require a 4, whilelearning who owned a bloodstained puppet fashioned acentury ago might be a 9.The greater the individual’s emotional connectionto the object, the stronger the impression he leaveson it — and the more information the Kindred canglean from it. Events involving strong emotions (a giftgiving, a torture, a long family history) likewise leavestronger impressions than short or casual contact do.Assume that each success offers one piece of information, as per the chart below.

		@-1 success			The character is overwhelmed bypsychic impressions for the next 30minutes and unable to act.

		@0 success		No information of value.

		@1 success		A second piece of basic information.

		@2 successes		More useful information about thelast owner, such as age and state ofmind the last time he used the item.

		@3 successes		Very basic information: the lastowner’s gender or hair color,for instance.

		@4 successes		The person’s name.

		@5+ successes		A wealth of information: nearlyanything you want to know about theperson’s relationship with that objectis available.

	**At the Storyteller’s discretion, some impressionson objects may be so strong — a knife plunged intoCaesar’s breast, the tip of the Spear of Destiny, a fangpulled from the maw of Dracula — that any use of thispower may be deemed a success.

	4:Telepathy

	*The vampire projects a portion of her consciousnessinto a nearby mortal’s mind, creating a mental linkthrough which she can communicate wordlessly oreven read the target’s deepest thoughts. The Kindred“hears” in her own mind the thoughts plucked from asubject as if they were spoken to her.This is one of the most potent vampiric abilities,since, given time, a Kindred can learn virtually anything from a subject without him ever knowing. TheTremere and Tzimisce in particular find this power especially useful in gleaning secrets from others, or fordirecting their mortal followers with silent precision.System: The player rolls Intelligence + Subterfuge(difficulty of the subject’s current Willpower points).Projecting thoughts into the target’s mind requires onesuccess. The subject recognizes that the thoughts comefrom somewhere other than his own consciousness,though he cannot discern their actual origin without asuccessful Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty equalto the v
ampire’s Manipulation + Subterfuge).To read minds, one success must be rolled for eachitem of information plucked or each layer of thoughtpierced. Deep secrets or buried memories are harder toobtain than surface emotions or unspoken comments,requiring five or more successes to access.Reading thoughts with Telepathy does not commonly work upon the undead mind. A character mayexpend a Willpower point to make the effort, making the roll normally afterward. Likewise, it is equallydifficult to read the thoughts of other supernaturalcreatures. However, the character may project herthoughts without expending a Willpower point. Thesethoughts, however, are still obviously intrusions intothe target’s mind, but the character may attempt to disguise her mental “voice” with a roll of Manipulation +Subterfuge (difficulty equals the target’s Perception +Awareness) so the target doesn’t recognize her as the“speaker.”Storytellers are encouraged to describe thoughts asflowing streams of
 impressions and images, rather thanas a sequence of prose (powers such as Telepathic Communication are of more use for that). Instead of makingflat statements like “He’s planning on killing his former lover’s new boyfriend,” say “You see a fleeting seriesof visions: A couple kissing passionately in a doorway,then the man walking alone at night; you suddenly seeyour hands, knuckles white, wrapped around a steering wheel, with a figure crossing the street ahead; yourheart, mortal now and hammering with panic as youhear the engine rev wildly; and above all, a blazing anger coupled with emotional agony and a panicked fearof loss.” Such descriptions not only add to the story, butthey also force the player to interpret for herself whather character gleans. After all, understanding minds —especially highly emotional or deranged minds — is adifficult and often puzzling task. damage), or hurtling toward the desired destination soforcefully that the silver cord snaps.

	5:Psychic

	*Projection An astral form may travel at great speeds (the Storyteller can use roughly 1000 miles per hour or 1500kilometers per hour as a general guide) and carries noclothing or material objects of any kind. Some artifactsare said to exist in the spirit world, and the charactercan try to use one of these tools if she finds one. Thecharacter cannot bring such relics to the physical worldwhen she returns to her body, however.

	**The Kindred with this awesome ability projects hersenses out of her physical shell, stepping from her bodyas an entity of pure thought. The vampire’s astral formis immune to physical damage or fatigue, and can “fly”with blinding speed anywhere across the earth — oreven underground — so long as she remains below themoon’s orbit.The Kindred’s material form lies in a torpid statewhile her astral self is active, and the vampire isn’taware of anything that befalls her body until she returnsto it. An ephemeral silver cord connects the Kindred’spsyche to her body. If this cord is severed, her consciousness becomes stranded in the astral plane (the realm ofghosts, spirits, and shades). Attempting to return to thevampire’s physical shell is a long and terrifying ordeal,especially since there is no guarantee that she will accomplish the journey successfully. This significant danger keeps many Kindred from leaving their bodies forlong, but those who dare can learn much.Sys
tem: Journeying in astral form requires the playerto expend a point of Willpower and make a Perception+ Awareness roll. Difficulty varies depending on the distance and complexity of the intended trip; 5 is withinsight, 7 is nearby or to a familiar location, and 9 reflects atrip far from familiar territory (a first journey from NorthAmerica to the Far East; trying to shortcut through theearth). The greater the number of successes rolled, themore focused the character’s astral presence is, and theeasier it is for her to reach her desired destination.Failure means the character is unable to separateher consciousness from her body, while a botch canhave nasty consequences — flinging her astral form toa random destination on Earth or in the spirit realm,arriving in a place where the sun is active (necessitating a frenzy roll, although the sunlight doesn’t do any

	**The player may spend a point of Willpower to activate this power, and an additional point of Willpower togain the success necessary to perform the jaunt. This isan exception to the normal rule where a player may notspend more than a single point of Willpower per turn.Each scene in Psychic Projection requires anotherpoint of Willpower and a new roll. Failure indicatesthat the vampire has lost her way and must retrace thepath of her silver cord. A botch at this stage means thecord snaps, stranding the character’s psychic form inthe mysterious astral plane.

	**Interaction with the physical world is impossiblewhile using Psychic Projection. At best, the charactermay spend a Willpower point to manifest as a ghostlike shape. This apparition lasts one turn before fadingaway; while she can’t affect anything physically during this time, the character can speak. Despite lackingphysical substance, an astral character can use Auspexnormally. At the Storyteller’s discretion, such a character may employ some or all Animalism, Dementation, Dominate, Necromancy, Obtenebration, Presence, Thaumaturgy, and similar non-corporeal powersshe has, though this typically requires a minimum ofthree successes on the initial Psychic Projection roll.If two astral shapes encounter one another, theyinteract as if they were solid. They may talk, touch,and even fight as if both were in the material world.Since they have no physical bodies, astral charactersseeking to interact “physically” substitute Mental andSocial Traits for Physical ones (Wits replaces Dext
erity, Manipulation supplants Strength, and Intelligencereplaces Stamina). Due to the lack of a material form,the only real way to damage another psychic entity isto cut its silver cord. When fighting this way, considerWillpower points to be health levels; when a combatant loses all of her Willpower, the cord is severed.Although an astrally projected character remains inthe reflection of the mortal world, she may venture further into the spirit realms, especially if she becomes lost. Other beings with particular sensitivity to psychicactivity, such as ghosts, werewolves, and even somemagi, travel the astral plane as well, and can interactwith a vampire’s psychic presence normally (althoughthe astrally projected character is not considered a“ghost” for powers such as Necromancy). The observing character notices the astrally projecting vampirewith a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 8), requiring more successes than the Psychic Projectionactivation roll. Even those who do no

Storytellers are encouraged to make trips into the spirit world as bizarre,mysterious, and dreamlike as possible. The world beyond is a vivid and fantastic place, where the true nature of things is stronger and often strikingly differentfrom their earthly appearances. begin their friends’ sentences. Prediction is a constantlow-level telepathic scan of the minds of everyone thecharacter is in proximity to. While this power does notgive the vampire the details of his neighbors’ consciousthoughts, it does provide a wealth of cues as to the subjects’ moods, suppressed reflexes, and attitudes towardthe topic of conversation.

	6: Clairvoyance 

	*By using Clairvoyance, a vampire can perceive distant events without using Psychic Projection. By concentrating on a familiar person, place, or object, acharacter can observe the subject’s immediate vicinitywhile staying aware of her own surroundings.System: The player rolls Perception + Empathy (difficulty 6) and describes the target she’s trying to lookin on. If the roll is successful, the character can thenperceive the events and environment surrounding thedesired target for one turn per success. Other Auspexpowers may be used on the scene being viewed; these arerolled normally. Clairvoyance does split the vampire’sperceptions between what she is viewing at a distanceand what is taking place around her. As a result, whileusing this power, a character is at +3 difficulty on all rollsrelating to actions that affect her physical surroundings.

	6: Prediction

	*Some people are capable of finishing their friends’sentences. Elder vampires with Prediction sometimes

	**System: Whenever the character is in conversationand either participant in the discussion makes a Socialroll, the player may pre-empt the roll to spend a bloodpoint and make a Perception + Empathy roll (difficulty of the target’s Manipulation + Subterfuge). Eachsuccess is an additional die that can be applied to theplayer’s Social roll or subtracted from the dice pool ofthe Social roll being made against the character.

	6: Telepathic Communication 

	*Telepathy (p. 137) allows a character to pick up onlythe surface thoughts of other individuals, and to speakto one at a time. With Telepathic Communication,a character can form a more powerful link betweenhis mind and that of other subjects, allowing them toconverse in words, concepts, and sensory images at thespeed of thought (and without the need for Willpowerexpenditure, unlike with Telepathy). Vampires withthis level of Auspex can act as “switchboard operators,”creating a telepathic web that allows all participants toshare thoughts with some or all other members of thenetwork as they choose.

	**System: The player rolls Charisma + Empathy (difficulty equals the target’s current Willpower points) toestablish contact, although a willing subject may allowthe vampire access and thus obviate the need for a roll.The maximum range at which a subject may be contacted and the maximum number of individuals whomay be linked simultaneously with this power dependson the Auspex rating of the vampire who initiates contact (see sidebar).

	7: Karmic Sight

	*The power of Aura Perception (Auspex 2) allows avampire to take a brief glimpse at the soul of a subject. This power takes Aura Perception several stepsforward, allowing a vampire who has mastered Auspex2 to probe the inner workings of a subject’s mind andsoul.System: The player rolls Perception + Empathy (difficulty equals the subject’s current Willpower). The degree of success determines the information gained.

		@-1 success			The character gains a Derangementor Psychological/Mental/Supernatural Flaw similar toone of the target’s for onenight, at Storyteller discretion.

		@1 success		As per five successes on anAura Perception roll.

		@2 successes		Subject’s Nature, Demeanor,and Humanity or Path can bedetermined.

		@3 successes		Any outside influences on thesubject’s mind or soul, such asDominate or a demonic pact,can be detected.

		@4 successes		Subject’s Willpower, Humanity orPath, and Virtue ratings canbe determined.

		@5 successes		The state of the subject’skarma may be determined.This is a highly abstract pieceof information best left toStoryteller discretion, butshould reveal the generalbalance between “good” and“bad” actions the subject hasperformed, both recently andover the course of hisexistence. If the plot meritsit, the character may receivevisions of one or moreincidents in the subject’s pastthat radically altered his destiny.With this degree of success, somefate-related Merits and Flaws (e.g.Dark Fate) can be identified as well.

	7:Mirror Reflex

	*This power was developed by a Toreador elder whomade a fearsome reputation through her fencing prowess, acting as a hired champion in dozens of Ventrueduels. Mirror Reflex is similar to Prediction in that it isin essence a low-level telepathic scan of an opponent,but this power taps into physical (rather than social)reflexes, allowing the character to anticipate an enemy’s moves in personal combat.System: The player spends a blood point and rollsPerception + the combat skill the opponent is using(difficulty of the subject’s Manipulation + combat skillin use). Each success is an additional die that can he applied to the character’s dice pools during the next turnof combat for any actions taken against the scanned opponent. The use of Mirror Reflex does take one combataction, and the power has a maximum range in yards ormeters equal to the character’s Willpower rating.

	8:Psychic Assault

	*Psychic Assault is nothing less than a direct mindto-mind attack which uses the sheer force of an elder’swill to overpower his target. Victims of Psychic Assaultshow little outward sign of the attack, save for nosebleeds and expressions of intense agony; all injuries bymeans of this psychic pressure inflicted are internal. Amedical examination of a mortal victim of a PsychicAssault invariably shows the cause of death to be aheart attack or aneurysm, while vampires killed withthis power decay to dust instantly, regardless of age.System: The character must touch or make eye contact with his target. The player spends three bloodpoints (and a Willpower point, if assaulting a vampireor other supernatural being) and rolls Manipulation +Intimidation in a contested roll against the victim’sWillpower. The result depends on the number of netsuccesses the attacker rolls.

		@-1 success			The target becomes immune to theattacker’s Psychic Assault for onenight per each “1” rolled.

		@0 success		The target is unharmed and maydetermine that a psychic assault istaking place by succeeding on aPerception + Awareness roll(difficulty 6).

		@1 success		The target is shaken but unharmed.He loses a temporary Willpowerpoint.

		@2 successes		The target is badly frightened. Heloses three temporary Willpowerpoints and, if a vampire, must rollCourage (difficulty of the attacker‘sAuspex rating) to avoid Rötschreck.

		@3 successes		The target loses six temporaryWillpower points and, if a vampire,must roll Courage as above. If thiscauses him to lose his last temporaryWillpower point, he loses apermanent Willpower point andreceives three health levels of bashingdamage (soaked normally).

		@4 successes		The target loses all temporaryWillpower points and half of hispermanent Willpower points (rounddown) and suffers three health levelsof lethal damage (soaked normally).

		@5 successes		The target must roll his permanentWillpower (difficulty 7). If hesucceeds, apply the effect of foursuccesses, and is also renderedunconscious for the rest of the night.If he fails, the Psychic Assault killshim instantly.

	9:False Slumber

	*Possibly the source of many Malkavians’ conviction that their sire is alive and well on the astral plane, thispower allows a Methuselah‘s spirit to leave his body whilein torpor. While seemingly asleep, the vampire is able toproject astrally, think, and perceive events normally.System: No roll is needed. This power is consideredto be active whenever the vampire’s body is in torpor,and astral travels are handled as per the rules for Psychic Projection. The vampire is not able to awakenphysically at will, however — waking from torpor ishandled per the normal rules for such an action (seep. 283).A vampire with this power whose silver cord is severed inastral combat loses all Willpower points, as per the rules forastral combat under Psychic Projection, but is not killed.Instead, he loses the use of this Auspex power and half ofhis permanent Willpower points. Both the Auspex 9 powerand the Willpower must be bought back with experiencepoints. The vampire’s soul slowly returns to
 his body overthe course of a year and a day, during which time he maynot be awakened from torpor by any means.



--Celerity

	*Not all vampires are slow, meticulous creatures.When needed, some vampires can move fast — reallyfast. Celerity allows Assamites, Brujah, and Toreadorsto move with astonishing swiftness, becoming practically a blur. The Assamites use their speed in conjunction with stealth to strike quickly and viciously fromthe shadows before they are noticed. Brujah, on theother hand, simply like the edge that the power givesthem against overwhelming odds. The Toreador aremore inclined to use Celerity to provide an air of unnatural grace to live performances or for an extra pushto complete a masterpiece on time, but they can beas quick to draw blood as any assassin or punk whenangered.System: Each point of Celerity adds one die to everyDexterity-related dice roll. In addition, the player canspend one blood point to take an extra action up to thenumber of dots he has in Celerity at the beginning ofthe relevant turn; this expenditure can go beyond hernormal Generation maximum. Any dots used for ex
traactions, however, are no longer available for Dexterity-related rolls during that turn. These additional actions must be physical (e.g., the vampire cannot use amental Discipline like Dominate multiple times in oneturn), and extra actions occur at the end of the turn(the vampire’s regular action still takes place per herinitiative roll).Normally, a character without Celerity must dividetheir dice if she wants to take multiple actions in asingle turn, as per p. 248. A character using Celerityperforms his extra actions (including full movement)without penalty, gaining a full dice pool for each separate action. Extra actions gained through Celerity maynot in turn be split into multiple actions, however.Celerity 6+Usually, elders progress in Celerity according to theexisting progression – more dots mean more dice andpotential actions a turn that are available, and levels6 through 9 have those powers available at each level,as normal. Similar to other Disciplines at level 6 orhigher
, though, alternative powers exist. If the elderwants to purchase an alternative power instead of thetypical progression (as per the sidebar on p. 127), shecan, but she forfeits the capacity an extra Dexterity dieand potential for an extra action to gain the special power instead. She can go back later and purchase the“normal” dot of Celerity later, as desired.Note that it isn’t possible to “skip” levels of progression for the normal Discipline – an elder with Celerity7 that buys Projective at level 6 needs to go back andbuy the normal level 6 power before getting the accessto his level 7 power that grants the capacity for up toseven Dexterity dice or actions in a turn.

	6: Projectile

	*Despite the fact that a vampire with Celerity movesat incredible speeds, any bullets he fires or knives hethrows while in this state don’t move any faster thanthey normally would. Scientifically minded Kindredhave been baffled by the phenomenon for centuries,but more pragmatic ones have found a way to workaround it. Projectile enables a vampire to take his preternatural speed and transfer it into something he hasthrown, fired, or launched.System: Projectile requires the expenditure of a bloodpoint. In addition, the player must decide how manylevels of his character’s Celerity he is putting into thespeed of the launched object. Thus, a character withCelerity 6 in addition to Projectile could decide to put three dots’ worth of speed into a knife he is throwing,and use the other three dots as dice or potential extraactions as per normal. Each dot of Celerity infused intoa thrown object becomes an automatic success to theattack’s damage roll, assuming the weapon or projectileact
ually hits.

	7: Flower of Death

	*In combat, speed kills. A proper application of Celerity in combat can turn even the meekest Cainiteinto a walking abattoir. How much more deadly, then,is a vampire with the ability to utilize his preternaturalspeed to the utmost in combat? Flower of Death allowsa vampire to take his Celerity and apply it in full toeach hand-to-hand or melee attack he makes.System: Flower of Death costs four blood points, butthe spectacular effect is well worth it. Once the poweris in effect, the vampire’s bonus dice for Dexterity rollsget added to every dice pool for attack the charactermakes (even if the roll doesn’t use Dexterity) until theend of the scene. Further, even if the Kindred uses someof his Celerity dots for extra actions during the scene,these extra dice are still available. The effect is limitedto hand-to-hand or melee weapon attacks — firearms, bows, and other ranged weapons are excluded — butdoes grant the attacker additional dice for damage rolls.Flower of Death is not cum
ulative — it is impossibleto “layer” uses of the power over one another to createastronomical dice pools. dragons breathing fire or gravity working in reverse).Sometimes, frequent targets of Chimerstry end up attempting to disbelieve everything around them, leading to derangements (and, quite often, to the amusement of the Ravnos).

	8: Zephyr

	*Zephyr produces an effect vaguely similar to one ofthe legendary comic book-style uses of enhanced speed,allowing its practitioner to run so fast he can run acrosswater. Particularly successful applications of Zephyr allow a vampire to go so far as to run up walls and, in atleast one recorded instance, across a ceiling.System: Zephyr requires the expenditure of one pointof blood and one point of Willpower. Unfortunately,Zephyr requires such extremes of concentration that itcannot be combined with any form of attack, or indeed,with most any sort of action at all. If a character usingZephyr feels the need to do something else while moving at such tremendous speeds, a Willpower roll (difficulty 8) is required. Needless to say, botches at Zephyrspeed can be spectacular in all the wrong ways.Most times, a vampire moving at such a rate of speedis barely visible, appearing more as a vampire-shapedblur than anything else. Observers must succeed on aPerception + Alertness roll (difficulty 7)
 to get a decent look at a Kindred zooming past in this fashion.

	**System: The player spends a point of Willpowerfor the vampire to create this illusion. The volume ofsmells, ambient lighting, smoke clouds, and the likeare limited to roughly 20 cubic feet (half a cubic meter) per dot the vampire has in Chimerstry. The illusion lasts until the vampire leaves its vicinity (such asstepping out of the room) or until another person seesthrough it somehow. The Cainite may also end the illusion at any time with no effort.



--Chimerstry

	*The Ravnos are known as masters of illusion, although the reason why is lost to history. Rumorsabound of Ravnos ghûls, rakshasas, and shapeshifters,but whatever its origins, Chimerstry remains a potentand powerful weapon for the Deceivers. The Disciplineis, fundamentally, an art of conjuration that convertsthe vampire’s will into phantoms that confound thesenses and technology alike. Even vampires fall underthe sway of the Ravnos’ illusory world, unless they havea strong enough grasp of Auspex (see p. 142). The Ravnos often use this power to swindle and seduce theirvictims into acts that work out badly for the victim(but great for the Ravnos).Illusions created by Chimerstry can be seen for whatthey are by a victim who “proves” the illusion’s falsehood (e.g., a person who walks up to an illusory wall,expresses his disbelief in it, and puts his hand throughit effectively banishes the illusion), and explicitly incredible illusions are seen as false immediately (e.g.,

	1:Ignis Fatuus

	*The vampire may conjure a minor, static mirage thatconfounds one sense. For instance, he may evoke a sulfurous stench, the appearance of stigmata, or the shatter of broken glass. Note that though tactile illusionscan be felt, they have no real substance; an invisiblebut tactile wall cannot confine anyone, and invisiblerazor-wire causes no real damage. Similarly, the vampire must know the characteristics of what he’s creating. While it’s easy enough to estimate what a knifewound might look like, falsifying a person’s voice or aphotograph of a childhood home requires knowledgeof the details.

	2:Fata Morgana

	*The Cainite can now create illusions that appeal toall the senses, though they remain static. For example,the vampire could make a filthy cellar appear as an opulent ballroom, though she could not create a glitteringchandelier or a score of graceful dancers. Again, theillusion has no solid presence, though it’s easy enoughto fool an enraptured visitor with suggestions of whatshe might expect. A bucket of brackish water is as coolas chilled champagne, after all.System: The player spends a Willpower point and ablood point to create the illusion. These static imagesremain until dispelled, in much the same way that anIgnis Fatuus illusion does.

	3:Apparition

	*Not really a power unto itself, Apparition allows avampire to give motion to an illusion created with Ignis Fatuus or Fata Morgana. Thus, the Cainite couldcreate the illusion of a living being, running water,fluttering drapes, or a roaring fire.

	**System: The creator spends one blood point to makethe illusion move in one significant way, or in anynumber of subtle ways. For example, the vampire couldcreate the illusion of a lurking mugger lurching at hervictim, or she could create the illusion of a desolatestreet, down which a chill wind blows trash while astreetlamp flickers and hums. Taking complicated actions besides maintaining the illusion — that is, anything that would require a dice roll — first requires success on a Willpower roll, resulting in the dissolution ofthe false construct if the roll fails.Once the creator stops concentrating on the illusion,it can continue in simple, repetitive motions – roughlyspeaking, anything that can be described in a simplesentence, such as a guard walking back and forth infront of a steel door. After that, the vampire cannotregain control over the illusion – she can either allowit to continue moving as ordered, or let it fade as described under Ignis Fatuus.

	4:Permanency

	*This power, also used in conjunction with IgnisFatuus or Fata Morgana, allows a mirage to persist evenwhen the vampire cannot see it. In this way, Ravnosoften cloak their temporary havens in false trappings ofluxury, or ward off trespassers with illusory guard dogs.System: The vampire need only spend a blood point,and the illusion becomes permanent until dissolved(including “programmed” illusions like those createdby Apparition).

	5:Horrid Reality

	*Rather than create simple illusions, the vampirecan now project hallucinations directly into a victim’smind. The target of these illusions believes completelythat the images are real; a hallucinatory fire can burnhim, an imaginary noose can strangle him, and an illusory wall can block him. This power affects only oneperson at a time; though others can see the illusion, itdoesn’t impact them in the same way. Other peoplecan try to convince the victim that his terrors are notreal, but he won’t believe them. Note that targets withenough dots in Auspex can still attempt to roll for Seeing the Unseen (p. 142).System: A Horrid Realty illusion costs two Willpower points to set in motion and lasts for an entirescene (though its effects may last longer; see below).If the vampire is trying to injure his victim, his playermust roll Manipulation + Subterfuge (difficulty of the victim’s Perception + Self-Control/Instinct). Eachsuccess inflicts one health level of lethal damage onthe vict
im that cannot be soaked — the Cainite assaults the victim’s mind and perceptions, not his body.If the player wishes to inflict less damage or change itto bashing, he may announce a maximum amount ofdamage before rolling the dice. Secondary effects (suchas frenzy rolls for illusory fire) may also occur.The victim heals all his damage instantaneously ifhe can be convinced that the damage he took was illusory, but convincing him may take some doing, suchas with at least two successes on a Charisma + Empathyroll (difficulty equal to the Manipulation + Subterfugeof the Cainite using Horrid Reality). The target mustbe convinced of the attack’s illusory nature within 24hours of its taking place, or it becomes too well established in his memory, and he will have to heal the damage using blood (if a vampire) or over time (if mortal).This power cannot actually kill its victims (though atarget with a heart condition may well die from fright).A victim “killed” by an illusory attack los
es consciousness or enters torpor.

	6: False Resonance

	*Illusions of living or unliving beings are all welland good until someone decides to read the illusion’smind or its aura. The automatic failure to perceive anysense of the target’s thoughts or emotions will usuallybe passed off as bad luck, lack of concentration, orwhatever reason any Kindred might construct to explain why he didn’t succeed in gleaning informationthrough supernatural means. A vampire can use FalseResonance to overlay auras and thoughts on illusions,as well as leave a trace that other emotionally resonantpowers can detect later.System: This power automatically applies to anyother use of Chimerstry as the user wishes. In effect,any attempt to use Auspex, the Dementation powerEyes of Chaos, or similar sensory powers that generatesfive or fewer successes will detect an aura, thoughts,Demeanor or whatever the power would normally detect. Thoughts won’t be exceptionally complex, andwill relate to whatever is going on around the illusionin a mundane and simplistic 
way. Auras will consistof colors related to specific emotions (anger, sadness,hatred, love, and happiness) and will not show muchcomplexity beyond that. Spirit’s Touch can pick up thesame emotional resonance until the next sunrise.

	6: Fatuus Mastery

	*A Ravnos with Fatuus Mastery has no restrictionon how often she may use the first three levels (IgnisFatuus, Fata Morgana, and Apparition) and can maintain or control illusions with minimal concentrationor fatigue. Kindred who rely on the high cost of Chimerstry to limit a vampire’s ability to use illusions are infor a very rude surprise when they encounter a Cainitewith this power.System: Fatuus Mastery negates the Willpower andblood cost for using the first three levels of Chimerstry.In addition, the Kindred may direct movement for anumber of illusions equal to his Intelligence withoutintense concentration. Furthermore, the character canmaintain the illusion as long as it remains within hisWillpower rating in miles (or about one and a halftimes that in kilometers), although he may not makeit react to events around it if he has no way to perceivethose events.

	6: Shared Nightmare

	*Even though Horrid Reality is visible to all onlookers, it can only inflict “damage” on one victim. WithShared Nightmare, a vampire can inflict her tormentedvisions on a crowd.System: To use this power, the player must spendtwo Willpower points, plus one blood point per target.The player rolls Manipulation + Subterfuge once, butcompares the results against each target individually.The difficulty is still each victim’s Perception + SelfControl/Instinct.

	7: Far Fatuus

	*This power allows a Kindred to project illusions toany area he can see or visualize. Under most circumstances, accomplishing this requires him to have visited the location in question before he can project illusions there. Although more difficult, a vampire mayproject illusions on the basis of a description, a photo,or a video clip.System: The difficulty for using Far Fatuus dependson the user’s familiarity with the location. The playermust roll Perception + Subterfuge to affect the location. Once this roll is successful, the vampire may thenuse any other Chimerstry power on that location.

	**Difficulty		Familiarity

		@6 successes		As familiar as one’s haven; currently viewing with Clairvoyance or PsychicProjection

		@7 successes		Visited three or more times

		@8 successes		Visited once; viewing on a live feed

		@9 successes		Described in detail; seen it in a video or have a undoctored photo

	7:Suspension of Disbelief

	*A Ravnos with this power can imbue her Chimerstrywith a sense of reality that makes it easier for viewers to believe in the illusion. No matter how strangeor surreal the illusion is, an onlooker will accept it asreal. If the illusion is wildly unrealistic (fire-breathingdragons, a pack of aliens), once it is no longer in hissight, the observer will question what he saw and eventually deny the event ever happened. A vampire canalso use this power to make something appear unbelievable, whether it’s real or not. In this case, observerswill write off what they’re seeing as some kind of trickor hallucination.System: The player rolls Manipulation + Subterfuge (difficulty 7). The number of successes determineshow many witnesses are affected. If the player uses thepower to make something look unbelievable, Auspexwill show the thing in question to be an illusion unlessthe Auspex rating is not high enough to penetrate theKindred’s Chimerstry.

		@1 success		Five people

		@2 successes		10 people

		@3 successes		25 people

		@4 successes		50 people

		@5 successes		Everyone who can see it

	8:Synesthesia

	*A Cainite who masters this power can shuffle others’ senses around to suit his preferences. He can select one target and inflict a serious, disorienting, andall-encompassing case of synesthesia upon her, making it impossible for her to interact meaningfully withthe real world for the power’s duration. The vampirehas complete control over how the target’s senses workand can manipulate them to suit. For example, he maydecide that she smells all sounds as varieties of nauseating stenches, or more subtly, he may exchange pain forpleasure. Used against a crowd, sensations are randomly shuffled, so one man will see what the woman next to him sees, but hears what the man 15 feet behind himhears and feels what the child a block away feels. Theend result is extremely disorienting for all victims.System: When used against a single victim, the player must spend one Willpower point and roll Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty is victim’s current Willpower points). For use against cr
owds, the difficulty is7, and the power affects everyone within the vampire’sline of sight and subtracts one point from Perceptionper success rolled. Victims whose Perception has beenreduced to zero can only sit down and wait for the disorientation to end. Duration against a single victim isdetermined below. Against a crowd, the power persistsuntil sunrise.

		@1 success		One week

		@2 successes		One month

		@3 successes		Six months

		@4 successes		One year

		@5 successes		Permanent

	9:Mayaparisatya

	*This expression of Chimerstry allows the Cainiteto directly alter or create real objects or creatures, although such changes are of finite duration. A vampirewith this power can transform the air around a rivalKindred into fire or render a locked door insubstantial.A more harrowing use of this power enables the vampire to force an object out of existence by transformingit into nothing more than a wisp of its former reality.System: To use this power, the player must spend 10blood points and one permanent Willpower point androll Manipulation + Subterfuge. Difficulty for the rollis 6 for affecting inanimate objects, and the victim’sWillpower rating for affecting characters. This powercan affect anything within miles (kilometers) of thevampire, as long as the character is aware of the targetin some way. If used with Far Fatuus, the effects arecentered on the chosen location. This power can affecta number of conscious targets equal to the Kindred’sWillpower per use.When dealing with 
inanimate objects, the numberof successes determines how drastic the alteration maybe. No matter how many successes the player rolls, theduration is always a scene. This power can affect anyobjects of a type within the vampire’s targeted area.

		@1 success		Render an object harmless (swordswon’t cut, firearms won’t shoot),create a large volume of obscuringsmoke

		@2 successes		Change an object into another object(turn candles into tarantulas, etc.)

		@3 successes		Render the object insubstantial, makesmoke solid

		@4 successes		Cause drastic changes (stone becomeshighly flammable)

		@5 successes		Cause the environment to behaveillogically (gravity twists sideways,rivers stand still as hills flow upward)

		@6+ successes		Delete any offending material objectsfrom existence. This effect ispermanent (to use this on conscioustargets, follow the system describedbelow).

	**When using the power on conscious targets, consultthe table above for alterations (such as forcing the victim into another form or transforming her into a different substance). If using the power to negate the victim’sexistence, the power inflicts two levels of unsoakableaggravated damage per success. If the power doesn’t killthe victim, subtract one dot of Strength and Staminaper success. The damage must be healed normally, butthe lost Attributes return at the end of the scene. Victims of this power look hazy and insubstantial. Victimsdestroyed with this power simply vanish.



--Dementation

	*Dementation is the Discipline that allows a vampireto focus and channel madness into the minds of thosearound him. Though it’s the natural legacy of the Malkavians, practitioners of Dementation need not actually be mad to use the Discipline… but it helps.Disturbingly, Dementation doesn’t actually maketheir victims mad, but rather it seems to break downthe doors to the hidden darkness of the target’s mind,releasing into the open whatever is found there. TheMalkavians claim that this is because insanity is thenext logical step in mental evolution, a transhumanist advancement of what modern people consider consciousness. Other Kindred scoff that this reasoning isan outright justification for the chaos that Dementation brings. They don’t scoff too loudly, however, lestthe Malkavian advance their consciousness next.

	1:Passion

	*The vampire stirs his victim’s emotions, eitherheightening them to a fevered pitch or blunting themuntil the target is completely desensitized. The Cainite may not choose which emotion is affected; she mayonly amplify or dull emotions already present in thetarget. In this way, a vampire can inflame mild irritation into quivering rage or atrophy true love into casual interest.System: The character talks to her victim, andthe vampire’s player rolls Charisma + Empathy (difficulty equals the victim’s Humanity or Path rating).The number of successes determines the duration ofthe altered state of feeling. Effects of this power mightinclude one- or two-point additions or subtractionsto difficulties of frenzy rolls, Virtue rolls, rolls to resistPresence powers, etc.

		@1 success		One turn

		@2 successes		One hour

		@3 successes		One night

		@4 successes		One week

		@5 successes		One month

		@6+ successes 		One year

	2:The Haunting

	*The vampire manipulates the sensory centers of hisvictim’s brain, flooding the victim’s senses with visions,sounds, scents, or feelings that aren’t really there. Theimages, regardless of the sense to which they appeal,are only fleeting “glimpses,” barely perceptible to thevictim. The vampire using Dementation cannot control what the victim perceives, but may choose whichsense is affected.The “haunting” effects occur mainly when the victim is alone, and mostly at night. They may take theform of the subject’s repressed fears, guilty memories,or anything else that the Storyteller finds dramaticallyappropriate. The effects are never pleasant or unobtrusive, however. The Storyteller should let her imagination run wild when describing these sensory impressions; the victim may well feel as if she is going mad, oras if the world is.

		@1 success		One night

		@2 successes		Two nights

		@3 successes		One week

		@4 successes		One month

		@5 successes		Three months

		@6+ successes 		Three months

	**System: After the vampire speaks to the victim, theplayer spends a blood point and rolls Manipulation +Subterfuge (difficulty of his victim’s Perception + SelfControl/Instinct). The number of successes determinesthe length of the sensory “visitations.” The precise effects are up to the Storyteller, though particularly eerie or harrowing apparitions can certainly reduce dicepools for a turn or two after the manifestation.

	3:Eyes of Chaos

	*This peculiar power allows the vampire to take advantage of the fleeting clarity hidden in insanity. Shemay scrutinize the “patterns” of a person’s soul, theconvolutions of a vampire’s inner nature, or even random events in nature itself. The Kindred with thispower can discern the most well-hidden psychoses, orgain insight into a person’s true self. Malkavians withthis power often have (or claim to have) knowledge ofthe moves and countermoves of the great Jyhad, or thepatterns of fate.

	**System: This power allows a vampire to determine aperson’s true Nature, among other things. The vampireconcentrates for a turn, then her player rolls Perception+ Occult. The difficulty depends on the intricacy of thepattern. Discerning the Nature of a stranger would bedifficulty 9, a casual acquaintance would be an 8, andan established ally a 6. The vampire could also readthe message locked in a coded missive (difficulty 7), oreven see the doings of an invisible hand in such eventsas the pattern of falling leaves (difficulty 6). Almostanything might contain some hidden insight, no matter how trivial or meaningless. The patterns are present in most things, but are often so intricate they cankeep a vampire spellbound for hours while she tries tounderstand their message.This is a potent power, subject to adjudication. Storytellers, this power is an effective way to introduceplot threads for a chronicle, reveal an overlooked clue,foreshadow important events, or communicate critical i
nformation a player seeks. Important to its use, though,is delivering the information properly. Secrets revealedvia Eyes of Chaos are never simple facts; they’re tantalizing symbols adrift in a sea of madness. Describe theresults of this power in terms of allegory: “The manbefore you appears as a crude marionette, with garishfeatures painted in bright stage makeup, and stringsvanishing up into the night sky.” Avoid stating plainly,“You learn that this ghoul is the minion of a powerfulMethuselah.”

	4:Voice of Madness

	*By merely addressing his victims aloud, the Kindredcan drive targets into fits of blind rage or fear, forcingthem to abandon reason and higher thought. Victimsare plagued by hallucinations of their subconscious demons, and try to flee or destroy their hidden shames.Tragedy almost always follows in the wake of this power’s use, though offending Malkavians often claim thatthey were merely encouraging people to act “accordingto their natures.” Unfortunately for the vampire concerned, he runs a very real risk of falling prey to hisown voice’s power.System: The player spends a blood point and makesa Manipulation + Empathy roll (difficulty 7). One target is affected per success, although all potential victims must be listening to the vampire’s voice.Affected victims fly immediately into frenzy or ablind fear like Rötschreck. Kindred or other creaturescapable of frenzy, such as Lupines, may make a frenzycheck or Rötschreck test (Storyteller’s choice as to howthey are affected
) at +2 difficulty to resist the power.Mortals are automatically affected and don’t remembertheir actions while berserk. The frenzy or fear lasts fora scene, though vampires and Lupines may test as usualto snap out of it.The vampire using Voice of Madness must also testfor frenzy or Rötschreck upon invoking this power,though his difficulty to resist is one lower than normal. If the initial roll to invoke this power is a failure,however, the roll to resist the frenzy is one higher thannormal. If the roll to invoke this power is a botch, thefrenzy or Rötschreck response is automatic.

	5:Total Insanity

	*The vampire coaxes the madness from the deepestrecesses of her target’s mind, focusing it into an overwhelming wave of insanity. This power has drivencountless victims, vampire and mortal alike, to unfortunate ends.

	**System: The Kindred must gain her target’s undivided attention for at least one full turn to enact thispower. The player spends a blood point and rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty of her victim’scurrent Willpower points). If the roll is successful, thevictim is afflicted with five derangements of the Storyteller’s choice (see p. 290). The number of successesdetermines the duration.

		@1 success		One turn

		@2 successes		One night

		@3 successes		One week

		@4 successes		One month

		@5+ successes 		One year

	**On a botch… well, the Storyteller can decide whata vampire inflicts upon herself by attempting to incitethe primal hells lurking within the darkest recesses ofa victim’s mind.The victim (or the target of a botch) can spend anumber of Willpower points equal to the successesrolled to end the duration prematurely. The Storytellerdecides when such Willpower points can be spent (suchas after a therapy session or after a friend has managedto prove a particular delusion to be false).

	6: Shattered Mirror

	*Although Dementation’s low-level effects are primarily to initiate or promote insanity rather than tocreate it spontaneously, some of its more potent manifestations are not as subtle. The wielder of this fearsome power can transfer her own deranged mindsetinto the psyche of a hapless victim, spreading her ownbrand of insanity like a virus.System: The vampire must establish eye contact(p. 152) with her intended victim to apply this power.The player then rolls Charisma + Subterfuge (difficultyequal to the target’s current Willpower points) resistedby the target’s Wits + Self-Control/Instinct (difficultyequal to the Dementation user’s current Willpowerpoints). If the aggressor wins, the target gains all of herderangements and Mental Flaws for a period of timedetermined by the number of net successes the aggressor scored:

		@1 success		one hour

		@2 successes		one night

		@3 successes		one week

		@4 successes		one month

		@5 successes		six months

		@6+ successes 		one year per success over 5

	6: Lingering Malaise

	*While lesser Dementation powers allow a vampire toinflict temporary (though often long-lasting) madnessupon a victim, elders of the Clan have developed theability to infect the minds of their victims with permanent maladies. Lingering Malaise causes permanentpsychological shifts within the victim, making him, asone Gangrel elder remarked, “an honorary Lunatic.”System: The character speaks to his victim for atleast a minute, describing the derangement that Lingering Malaise will inflict. The player rolls Manipulation + Empathy (difficulty equal to the victim’s currentWillpower points); the victim resists with a Willpowerroll (using his permanent Willpower at difficulty 8). Ifthe user of Lingering Malaise scores more successes, thevictim gains a permanent derangement chosen by theindividual who inflicts it. Lingering Malaise may onlybe used to inflict one derangement per night on anygiven victim, though multiple attempts may be madeuntil the derangement takes hold.

	7: Restructure

	*The elder with this fearsome power has the abilityto twist his victims’ psyches at their most basic levels,warping their very beings. The subject of Restructureretains her memories, but her outlook on life changescompletely, as if she has undergone a sudden epiphanyor religious conversion. This effect goes much deeperthan the implantation of a derangement; it actuallyperforms a complete rewrite of the victim’s personality.System: As the description says, this power allowsthe vampire to change his target’s Nature to one moresuitable to his ends. To accomplish this, the charactermust make eye contact (p. 152) with his intended victim. The player rolls Manipulation + Subterfuge (difficulty equals the victim’s Wits + Subterfuge). If he rollsa number of successes equal to or greater than the target’s Self-Control/Instinct, the target’s Nature changesto whatever the player using Restructure desires. This effect is permanent and can be undone only by anotherapplication of Restr
ucture (though subtle differencesfrom the character’s original Nature may still remain,as it is impossible for such a fundamental change to occur flawlessly). A botch on this roll changes the character’s own Nature to that of his intended victim.

	8: Personal Scourge

	*Similar to the Auspex power of Psychic Assault(p. 141), this fearsome ability allows the elder to turnthe very strength of her victim’s mind against him,inflicting physical harm with the power of his ownwill. Victims of this self-powered attack spontaneouslyerupt in lacerations and bruises, spraying blood in every direction and howling in agony. Those who haveobserved such an attack with Auspex note that thevictim’s aura swirls with violent psychosis and eruptsoutward in writhing appendages — a sight that canmake even the most jaded Tzimisce quail.System: The vampire must touch or establish eyecontact (p. 152) with her target. The player rolls Manipulation + Empathy (difficulty equal to the target’sStamina + Self-Control/Instinct) and spends two Willpower points. For a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, the victim rolls his own permanent Willpower as lethal damage against himself. Thisdamage can be soaked with his own Humanity or Pathof Enlightenment (d
ifficulty 6); Fortitude does not addto this soak dice pool, nor does body armor. He maytake no actions during this time other than thrashingand gibbering; this includes spending blood to heal.

	9:Lunatic Eruption

	*This fearsome ability is only known to have beenapplied a few times in recorded Kindred history, mostspectacularly during the final nights of the last battle ofCarthage. It is effectively a psychic nuclear bomb, usedto incite every intelligent being within several miles(kilometers) into an orgy of bloodlust and rage. It issuspected that the Malkavians have used the threat ofthis power as a bargaining chip in several key negotiations.System: The player spends four Willpower pointsand rolls Stamina + Intimidation (difficulty 8). Thearea of effect is determined by the number of successesscored:

		@1 success		One city block

		@2 successes		An entire neighborhood

		@3 successes		A large downtown area

		@4 successes		Several neighborhoods

		@5 successes		An entire metropolitan area(approximately 30 miles or45 kilometers)

		@6+ successes 		An additional 10 miles or 15	kilometers for every success past 5Within this area, all sentient creatures fall preyto their baser instincts. Mortals spontaneously riot,looting and burning between bouts of mass violence.Kindred enter hunger-induced frenzies, draining dryas many vessels as they can sink their fangs into. Anentire city can quite literally be driven temporarily insane by this power. Lunatic Eruption’s effects persistuntil the next sunrise, and anyone entering its area ofeffect (centered on the site at which it was used, noton the character who applied it) falls under its spell.However, momentum may carry the violence spawnedby this power much farther — and keep it going muchlonger — than the power itself can force.Victims of Lunatic Eruption may resist with SelfControl/Instinct rolls (difficulty equal to the Dementation user’s permanent Willpower rating); each successprovides one hour of lucidity, which most wise individuals use to leave the power
’s area of effect (leaving the “blast radius” removes the power’s influence).The source of Lunatic Eruption may be pinpointed ifa character is using Heightened Senses or an equivalent power at the time it is used; this is automatic andrequires no roll. However, this grants no knowledge ofwhat actually happened — the observer simply “feels”a massive psychic shockwave explode from the character using the power.

		

--Dominate

	*Dominate is one of the most dreaded of Disciplines.It is a vampire’s ability to influence another person’sthoughts and actions through her own force of will.Dominate requires that the vampire capture her victim’s gaze (see p. 152); as such, it may be used againstonly one subject at a time. Further, commands must beissued verbally, although simple orders may be madewith signs — for example, a pointed finger and forceful expression to indicate “Go!” However, the subjectwon’t comply if he can’t understand the vampire, nomatter how powerful the Kindred’s will is.Perhaps unsurprisingly, vampires to which Dominatecomes naturally tend to be from willful, domineeringClans. The Giovanni, Lasombra, Tremere, and Ventrue all consider an iron will to be a boon, and are eager to impose that iron will on any who would moveagainst them.

	1:Command

	*The vampire locks eyes with the subject and speaksa one-word command, which the subject must be obeyinstantly. The order must be clear and straightforward:run, agree, fall, yawn, jump, laugh, surrender, stop,scream, follow. If the command is at all confusing orambiguous, the subject may respond slowly or performthe task poorly. The subject cannot be ordered to dosomething directly harmful to herself, so a commandlike “die” is ineffective.The command may be included in a sentence, thereby concealing the power’s use from others. This effort at subtlety still requires the Kindred to make eyecontact at the proper moment and stress the key wordslightly. An alert bystander — or even the victim —may notice the emphasis. Still, unless she’s conversantwith supernatural powers, the individual is likely toattribute the utterance and the subsequent action tobizarre coincidence.System: The player rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty equals the target’s current Willpowerpoi
nts). More successes force the subject to act withgreater vigor or for a longer duration (continue running for a number of turns, go off on a laughing jag,scream uncontrollably).Remember, too, that being commanded to againstone’s Nature confounds the use of this power. Beingtold to “sleep!” in a dangerous situation or “attack!”in police custody may not have the desired effect, orindeed, any effect at all.

	2:Mesmerize

	*With this power, a vampire can verbally implant afalse thought or hypnotic suggestion in the subject’ssubconscious mind. Both Kindred and target must befree from distraction, since Mesmerize requires intenseconcentration and precise wording to be effective. Thevampire may activate the imposed thought immediately or establish a stimulus that will trigger it later. Thevictim must be able to understand the vampire, thoughthe two need to maintain eye contact only as long as ittakes to implant the idea.Mesmerize allows for anything from simple, precisedirectives (handing over an item) to complex, highlyinvolved ones (taking notes of someone’s habits andrelaying that information at an appointed time). It isnot useful for planting illusions or false memories (suchas seeing a rabbit or believing yourself to be on fire). Asubject can have only one suggestion implanted at anytime.

	**System: The player rolls Manipulation + Leadership (difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpowerpoints). The number of successes determines how wellthe suggestion takes hold in the victim’s subconscious.If the vampire scores one or two successes, the subjectcannot be forced to do anything that seems strange toher (she might walk outside, but is unlikely to steal acar). At three or four successes, the command is effective unless following it endangers the subject. At fivesuccesses or greater, the vampire can implant nearlyany sort of command.No matter how strong the Kindred’s will, his command cannot force the subject to harm herself directlyor defy her innate Nature. So, while a vampire whoscored five successes could make a 98-pound weaklingattack a 300-pound bouncer, he could not make themortal shoot herself in the head.If a vampire tries to Mesmerize a subject before thetarget fulfills a previously implanted directive, compare the successes rolled to those gained duri
ng the implanting of the first suggestion. Whichever roll had thegreater number of successes is the command that nowgoverns in the target’s behavior; the other suggestion iswiped clean. If the successes rolled are equal, the newercommand supplants the old one.

	3:The Forgetful Mind

	*After capturing the subject’s gaze, the vampire delvesinto the subject’s memories, stealing or re-creatingthem at his whim. The Forgetful Mind does not allowfor telepathic contact; the Kindred operates much likea hypnotist, asking directed questions and drawing outanswers from the subject. The degree of memory alteration depends on what the vampire desires. He may alter the subject’s mind only slightly (quite effective foreliminating memories of the victim meeting or evenbeing fed upon by the vampire) or utterly undo the victim’s memories of her past.The degree of detail used has a direct bearing on howstrongly the new memories take hold, since the victim’s subconscious mind resists the alteration. A simplistic or incomplete false memory (“You went to themovies last night”) crumbles much more quickly thandoes one with more attention to detail (“You thoughtabout texting your girlfriend while you were in line atthe new movie theater, but you knew you’d have toturn yo
ur phone off once you got inside. You liked themovie well enough, but the plot seemed weak. Youwere tired after it ended, so you went home, watched alittle late-night television, and went to bed.”).

	**Even in its simplest applications, The Forgetful Mindrequires tremendous skill and finesse. It’s a relativelysimple matter to rifle through a victim’s psyche and ripout the memories of the previous night without knowing what the subject did that evening. Doing so leavesa gap in the victim’s mind, however — a hole that cangive rise to further problems down the road. The Kindred may describe new memories, but these recollections seldom have the same degree of realism that thesubject’s original thoughts held.As such, this power isn’t always completely effective.The victim may remember being bitten, but believe itto be an animal attack. Greater memories may returnin pieces as dreams, or through sensory triggers likea familiar odor or spoken phrase. Even so, months oryears may pass before the subject regains enough of herlost memories to make sense of the fragments.A vampire can also sense when a subject’s memorieswere altered through use of this power, and even restorethe
m, as a hypnotist draws forth suppressed thoughts.System: The player states what sorts of alteration hewants to perform, then rolls Wits + Subterfuge (difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpower points).Any success pacifies the victim for the amount of timeit takes the vampire to perform the verbal alteration,provided the vampire does not act aggressively towardher. The table below indicates the degree of modification possible to the subject’s memory. If the successesrolled don’t allow for the extent of change the character desired, the Storyteller reduces the resulting impacton the victim’s mind.

		@1 success		May remove a single memory;lasts one day.

		@2 successes		May remove, but not alter, memorypermanently.

		@3 successes		May make slight changes to memory.

		@4 successes		May alter or remove entire scenefrom subject’s memory.

		@5 successes		May reconstruct entire periods ofsubject’s life.

	**To restore removed memories or sense false onesin a subject, the character’s Dominate rating must beequal to or higher than that of the vampire who madethe alteration. In that situation, the player must makea Wits + Empathy roll (difficulty equal to the original vampire’s permanent Willpower rating) and scoremore successes than his predecessor did. However, theKindred cannot use The Forgetful Mind to restore hisown memories if they were stolen in such a way.

	4:Conditioning

	*Through sustained manipulation, the vampire canmake a subject more pliant to the Kindred’s will. Overtime, the victim becomes increasingly susceptible tothe vampire’s influence while simultaneously growingmore resistant to the corrupting efforts of other Kindred. Gaining complete control over a subject’s mindis no small task, taking weeks or even months to accomplish.Kindred often fill their retainers’ heads with subtlewhispers and veiled urges, thereby ensuring these mortals’ loyalty. Yet vampires must pay a high price forthe minds they ensnare. Servants Dominated in thisway lose much of their passion and individuality. Theyfollow the vampire’s orders quite literally, seldom taking initiative or showing any imagination. In the end,such retainers become like automatons or the walkingdead.System: The player rolls Charisma + Leadership (difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpower points)once per scene. Conditioning is an extended action, forwhich the Storyteller s
ecretly determines the numberof successes required. It typically requires between fiveand 10 times the subject’s Self-Control/Instinct rating. Targets with more empathic Natures may requirea lower number of successes, while those with willfulNatures require a higher total. Only through roleplaying may a character discern whether his subject is conditioned successfully.A target may become more tractable even beforebecoming fully conditioned. Once the vampire accumulates half the required number of successes, the Storyteller may apply a lower difficulty to the vampire’ssubsequent uses of Dominate. After being conditioned,the target falls so far under the vampire’s influence thatthe Kindred need not make eye contact or even bepresent to retain absolute control. The subject does exactly as she is told (including taking actions that wouldinjure herself), as long as her master can communicatewith her verbally. No command roll is necessary unless the subject is totally isolated from th
e vampire’spresence (in a different room, over the phone). Evenif a command roll fails, the target will still likely carryout part of the orders given, simply because her masterwishes it.

	**After the subject is fully conditioned, other Kindredfind her more difficult to Dominate. Such conditioningraises others’ difficulties by two (to a maximum of 10).It is possible, though difficult, to shake Conditioning. The subject must be separated entirely from thevampire to whom she was in thrall. This period ofseparation varies depending on the individual, butthe Storyteller may set it at six months, less a numberof weeks equal to the subject’s permanent Willpowerrating (so a person with 5 Willpower must stay awayfrom the vampire for just under five months). Thesubject regains her personality slowly during this time,though she may still lapse into brief spells of listlessness, despair, or even anger. If the vampire encountersthe target before that time passes, a single successfulCharisma + Leadership roll (difficulty of the target’scurrent Willpower points) on the part of the vampirecompletely reasserts the dominance.If the subject makes it through the time period without
 intervention by her master, the target regains herformer individuality. Even so, the vampire may reestablish conditioning more easily than the first time,since the subject is now predisposed to falling underthe Kindred’s mental control. New attempts requirehalf the total number of successes than the last bout ofconditioning did (which means the subject reaches thethreshold for reduced difficulties sooner, as well).

	**possessed in this way, although ghouls that have drunkfrom the vampire using Possession can.System: The vampire must completely strip away thetarget’s Willpower prior to possessing her. The playerspends a Willpower point, then rolls Charisma + Intimidation, while the subject rolls his Willpower in aresisted action (difficulty 7 for each). For each successthe vampire obtains over the victim’s total, the targetloses a point of temporary Willpower. Only if the attacker botches can the subject escape her fate, sincethis makes the target immune to any further Dominateattempts by that vampire for the rest of the story.Once the target loses all her temporary Willpower,her mind is open. The vampire rolls Manipulation +Intimidation (difficulty 7) to determine how fully heassumes control of the mortal shell. Similar to the Animalism power Subsume the Spirit, multiple successesallow the character to utilize some mental Disciplines,noted on the chart below. (Vampires possessing ghoulscan u
se the physical Disciplines the ghoul possesses,but not the mental ones.)

	5:Possession

	*At this level of Dominate, the force of the Kindred’spsyche is such that it can utterly supplant the mind ofa mortal subject. Speaking isn’t required, but the vampire must capture the victim’s gaze. During the psychicstruggle, the contestants’ eyes are locked on one another.

	**Once the Kindred overwhelms the subject’s mind,the vampire moves his consciousness into the victim’sbody and controls it as easily as he uses his own. Themortal falls into a mental fugue while under possession.She is aware of events only in a distorted, dreamlikefashion. In turn, the vampire’s mind focuses entirelyon controlling his mortal subject. His own body liesin a torpid state, defenseless against any actions madetoward it.Vampires cannot possess one another in this fashion,as even the weakest Kindred’s mind is strong enoughto resist such straightforward mental dominance. Onlythrough a blood bond can one vampire control anotherto this degree. Supernatural creatures also cannot be

	**The character may travel as far from his body as he isphysically able while possessing the mortal. The vampire may also venture out during the day in the mortalform. However, the vampire’s own body must be awaketo do so, requiring a successful roll to remain awake(see p. 262). If the vampire leaves the mortal shell (bychoice, if his body falls asleep, through supernatural expulsion, after sustaining significant injury, etc.), his consciousness returns to his physical form in an instant.Once freed from possession, the mortal regains mental control of herself. This can happen in an instant, orthe victim may lie comatose for days while her psychecopes with the violation.

	**The vampire experiences everything the mortal bodyfeels during possession, from pleasure to pain. In fact,any damage the victim’s body sustains is also appliedto the character’s body (though the Kindred may soakas normal). If the mortal dies before the vampire’s soulcan flee from the body, the character’s body falls intotorpor. Presumably this is in sympathetic response tothe massive trauma of death, though some Kindred believe that the vampire’s soul is cast adrift during thistime and must find its way back to the body.The Kindred can remain in the mortal’s body even ifhis own torpid form is destroyed, though such a patheticcreature is not likely to exist for long. At each sunrise,the vampire must roll Courage (difficulty 8) or be expelled from the body. If forced from the mortal body, thevampire tumbles into the astral plane, his soul permanently lost in the spirit world. A vampire trapped in amortal body may not be “re-Embraced.” If the Embraceoccurs to such a cr
eature, he simply meets Final Death.

		@1 success		Cannot use Disciplines

		@2 successes		Can use Auspex and other sensorypowers

		@3 successes		Can also use Presence and otherpowers of emotional manipulation

		@4 successes		Can also use Dementation,Dominate, and other powersof mental manipulation

		@5 successes		Can also use Chimerstry,Necromancy, Thaumaturgy,and other mystical powers

	6: Chain the Psyche

	*Not content with merely commanding their subjects,some elders apply this power to ensure obedience fromrecalcitrant victims. Chain the Psyche is a Dominatetechnique that inflicts incapacitating pain on a targetwho attempts to break the vampire’s commands.System: The player spends a blood point when hercharacter applies Dominate to a subject. Any attemptthat the subject makes to act against the vampire’simplanted commands or to recover stolen memoriescauses intense pain. When such an attempt is made,the Storyteller rolls the character‘s Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty equal to the subject’s Stamina +Empathy). Each success equals one turn that the victim is unable to act, as she is wracked with agony. Eachapplication of Chain the Psyche crushes a number ofresistance attempts equal to the character’s Manipulation rating, after which the effect fades.

	6: Loyalty

	*With this power in effect, the elder’s Dominate is sostrong that other vampires find it almost impossible tobreak with their own commands. Despite the name,Loyalty instills no special feelings in the victim — thevampire’s commands are simply implanted far moredeeply than normal.System: Any other vampire attempting to employDominate on a subject who has been Dominated by avampire with Loyalty has a +3 difficulty modifier to hisrolls and must spend an additional Willpower point.

	7: Obedience

	*While most Kindred must employ Dominate througheye contact, some powerful elders may command loyalty with the lightest brush of a hand.System: The character can employ all Dominatepowers through touch instead of eye contact (althougheye contact still works). Skin contact is necessary —simply touching the target’s clothing or something sheis holding will not suffice. The touch does not have tobe maintained for the full time it takes to issue a Dominate command, though repeated attempts to Dominatea single target require the character to touch the subject again.

	7: Mass Manipulation

	*A truly skilled elder may command small crowdsthrough the use of this power. By manipulating thestrongest minds within a given group, a gathering maybe directed to the vampire’s will.System: The player declares that he is using thispower before rolling for the use of another Dominatepower. The difficulty of the roll is that which would berequired to Dominate the most resistant member of thetarget group — if he cannot be Dominated, no one inhis immediate vicinity can. For every success past thatneeded to inflict the desired result on the first target,the player may choose one additional target to receivethe same effect in its entirety. The vampire needs tomake eye contact only with the initial target.

	7:Still the Mortal Flesh

	*Despite its name, this power may be employed onvampires as well as mortals, and it has left more thanone unfortunate victim writhing in agony — or unableto do even that. A vampire who has developed thispower is able to override her victim’s body as easily ashis mind in order to cut off his senses or even stop hisheart. It is rumored that this power once came moreeasily to the Kindred, but modern medicine has madethe bodies and spirits of mortals more resistant to suchmanipulations.System: The player rolls Manipulation + Medicine(difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpowerpoints + 2; a difficulty over 10 means that this powercannot affect the target at all). The effect lasts for oneturn per success. The player must choose what function of the target’s body is being cut off before rolling.She may affect any of the body’s involuntary functions;breathing, circulation, perspiration, sight, and hearingare all viable targets. While Still the Mortal Flesh is in effect, a va
mpire can either stop any one of those functions entirely or cause them to fluctuate erratically.The exact effects of any given bodily function beingshut off are left to the Storyteller. Most mortals panicif suddenly struck blind, but only the shutdown of theheart will kill a target on the spot. Vampires are unaffected by loss of heartbeat or breathing, but may berendered deaf and blind as easily as mortals.

	8:Far Mastery

	*This refinement of Obedience (though the characterneed not have learned Obedience first) allows the useof Dominate on any subject that the vampire is familiarwith, at any time, over any distance. If the elder knowswhere his target is, he may issue commands as if hewere standing face- to-face with his intended victim.System: The player spends a Willpower point androlls Perception + Empathy (difficulty equal to the subject’s Wits + Stealth) to establish contact. If this rollsucceeds, Dominate may be used as if the character hadestablished eye contact with the target. A second Willpower point must be spent in order for a vampire to usethis power on another vampire or other supernaturalbeing.

	9:Speak Through the Blood

	*The power structures of Methuselahs extend acrosscontinents and centuries. This power allows such ancients to wield control over their descendants, eventhose far outside their geographic spheres of influence.Speak Through the Blood allows an elder to issue commands to every vampire whose lineage can be tracedto her — even if the two have never met. Thus, entire broods act to further the goals of sleeping ancientswhose existences they may be completely unaware of.The vampires affected by this power rarely act directlyto pursue the command they were given, but over adecade or so, their priorities slowly shift until the fulfillment of the Methuselah‘s command is among theirlong-term goals. Speak Through the Blood, because ittakes effect so slowly, is rarely recognized as an outsideinfluence, and its victims rationalize their behavior as“growing and changing,” or something to that effect. 

	**System: The player spends a permanent Willpowerpoint and rolls Manipulation + Leadership. The difficulty of this roll is equal to four plus the number ofGenerations to which the command is to be passed.Unless the character is aware of the location and present agenda of every descendant of his — a highly unlikely event — he may only issue general commands, such as “work for the greater glory of Clan Malkavian”or “destroy all those who seek to extinguish the lightof knowledge.” Speak Through the Blood can be usedby a vampire in torpor. Commands issued through thispower last for one decade per success on the roll. Difficulties over 10 require one additional success for eachpoint past 10, making it that much more difficult toissue long-lasting commands stretching down to theends of one’s lineage.A vampire who has reached Golconda is not affectedby this power, and is completely unaware that it hasbeen used. Her childer, however, are affected normallyunless they are also en
lightened. Ghouls of the victimsof this power are also affected, but to a lesser extent.



--Fortitude

	*Although all vampires have an unnatural constitutionthat make them much sturdier than mortals, Fortitudebestows a resilience that would make an action moviehero envious. Vampires with this Discipline can shrugoff agonizing trauma and make the most bone-shattering impact look like a flesh wound. The power even offers protection against the traditional banes of vampires,such as sunlight and fire, and the Gangrel, Ravnos, andVentrue all find that edge incredibly useful.System: A character’s rating in Fortitude adds to hisStamina for the purposes of soaking normal damage(bashing and lethal). A character with this Disciplinemay also use his dots in Fortitude to soak aggravateddamage, though Kindred cannot normally soak thingslike vampire bites, werewolf claws, magical effects, fire,sunlight, or massive physical trauma. See p. 272, forfurther details on soaking and damage.Fortitude 6+Elder vampires progress in Fortitude in the same wayas Celerity (see p. 142). They can increase their ba
sicmastery of the Discipline or to take an alternate powersuch as one of those detailed below.

	6: Personal Armor

	*Nobody likes to get hit, not even Cainites. Theeasiest way to ensure that one is not hit (or shot, orstabbed) repeatedly is to take the weapon with whichone is assaulted away from one’s attacker and break it.That’s where Personal Armor comes in. This application of Fortitude, derived from one popular in the 12thcentury, causes anything that strikes a Kindred whoemploys Personal Armor to shatter on impact.System: With the expenditure of two blood points,a vampire can add preternatural hardness to his flesh.Every time an attack is made on the Kindred using Personal Armor (one which he fails to dodge), his playerrolls Fortitude (difficulty 8). If the roll grants more successes than the attacker rolled, then the weapon usedto make the attack shatters against the vampire’s flesh.(“Magical” weapons may be resistant to this effect, atthe Storyteller’s discretion.) The vampire still takesnormal damage if the attack is successful, even if theweapon shatters in the process, though
 this damagemay be soaked. If the attack roll botches, any normalweapon automatically shatters.A hand-to-hand attack causes the attacker equaldamage to that suffered by the defender when PersonalArmor comes into play. If the attacker misses entirely,she still takes one level of bashing damage.The effects of this power last for the duration of thescene.

	7: Shared Strength

	*It’s one thing to laugh off bullets, rather another towatch the ricochets mow down everyone around you.Many Kindred have wished, at one time or another,that they could lend their monstrous vitality to thosearound them. Those few vampires who have masteredShared Strength can — if only for a little while.System: Shared Strength duplicates a portion of avampire’s Fortitude (one dot for every point of bloodthe vampire spends) to another being. Activating thepower requires a Stamina + Survival roll (difficulty 8,increased to 9 if the target is not a normal mortal), andthe expenditure of a point of Willpower. Furthermore,the vampire must mark his target by pressing a drop ofhis blood onto the target’s forehead. This stain remainsvisible as long as the power is in effect, the duration ofwhich is determined by the initial roll.

		@1 success		One turn

		@2 successes		One scene

		@3 successes		One hour

		@4 successes		One night

		@5 successes		One week

		@6 successes		One month

		@7 successes		One year

	**The target of this power need not be willing to accept the benefit to receive it, and the bestowing vampire can end the effect at any time for no cost. Particularly sadistic Kindred have come up with any numberof ways in which a target’s “devil’s mark” and supernatural endurance can be used to land him in a greatdeal of trouble.A vampire can never bestow more levels of Fortitudethan he himself possesses.

	8: Adamantine

	*Adamantine functions as a more potent version ofPersonal Armor.System: This power mimics the effects of PersonalArmor, save that the vampire who uses it takes nodamage from attacks that shatter on her skin.



--Obfuscate

	*Obfuscate is the uncanny ability for Kindred to conceal themselves from sight, sometimes even in fullview of a crowd. An Obfuscated vampire doesn’t actually become invisible, however — rather, he is able todelude observers into believing that he has vanished.Obfuscate also allows Kindred to change their featuresand conceal other people or objects. Typically vampires using Obfuscate must be within a short range oftheir witnesses (approximately five yards or meters perdot of Wits + Stealth) for their power to be effective.Unless the Kindred chooses to make herself seen,she can remain obscured for as long as she wills it. Athigher levels, the vampire can actually fade from sight so subtly that those nearby can’t actually recall the moment at which she left.Usually, few mortals or supernaturals (even thosetrained in Awareness) can pierce through the fog ofObfuscate. Animals, who rely more on their instinctsthan their normal senses, can sometime perceive (andbe frightened by) the v
ampire’s presence. Children andthose to whom deception is foreign may also be ableto pierce the illusion, at the Storyteller’s discretion.Finally, the Auspex Discipline enables Kindred to seethrough Obfuscate. Even that is not guaranteed, however; refer to “Seeing the Unseen,” p. 142, for moredetails. (Storytellers needing a die roll for animals orchildren can use this quick and dirty guideline: treatthem as if they had Auspex 1 in terms of contestingObfuscate. They do not have the Auspex 1 power, butare considered to have it when determining whether avampire is noticed.)Since Obfuscate clouds the mind of the viewer, vampires can’t use it to hide their presence from electronicor mechanical devices. Video and photo cameras, forexample, capture the vampire’s image accurately. Evenso, the person using, say, her cell phone to record anObfuscated vampire will still have her mind impactedby the power, and she won’t see the Kindred’s image until she views the video at a later
 date (if eventhen).Several Clans cultivate this power — the Assamites, Followers of Set, and Malkavians, for example— but the Nosferatu are particularly known for thisDiscipline. Some elder Kindred believe that Caine, orperhaps Lilith, bestowed the Clan with this Disciplineto compensate for the hideous physical deformities itsmembers suffer.Most Obfuscate powers last for a scene, or until thevampire ceases maintaining them. Once evoked, theyrequire very little mental effort to keep in place.

	1:Cloak of Shadows

	*At this level, the vampire must rely on nearby shadows and cover to assist in hiding his presence. He stepsinto an out-of-the-way, shadowed place and eases himself from normal sight. The vampire remains unnoticedas long as he stays silent, still, under some degree ofcover (such as a curtain, bush, door frame, lamppost,or alley), and out of direct lighting. The immortal’sconcealment vanishes if he moves, attacks, or falls under direct light. Furthermore, the vampire’s deceptioncannot stand up to concentrated observation withoutfading.

	**System: No roll is required as long as the characterfulfills the criteria described above. So long as he remains quiet and motionless, virtually no one but another Kindred with a high enough Auspex rating willsee him.

	2:Unseen PresenceWith experience, the vampire can move aroundwithout being seen. Shadows seem to shift to coverhim, and people automatically avert their gazes as hepasses by. Others move unconsciously to avoid contactwith the cloaked creature; those with weak wills mayeven scurry away from the area in unacknowledgedfear. The vampire remains ignored indefinitely unlesssomeone deliberately seeks him out or he inadvertentlyreveals himself.Since the vampire fully retains his physical substance, he must be careful to avoid contact with anything that may disclose his presence (knocking over avase, bumping into someone). Even a whispered wordor the scuffing of a shoe against the floor can be enoughto disrupt the power.System: No roll is necessary to use this power unlessthe character speaks, attacks, or otherwise draws attention to himself. The Storyteller should call for a Wits +Stealth roll under any circumstances that might causethe character to reveal himself. The difficulty of theroll 
depends on the situation; stepping on a squeakyfloorboard might be a 5, while walking through a poolof water may require a 9. Other acts may require a certain number of successes; speaking quietly without giving away one’s position, for instance, demands at leastthree successes. Upon success, the vampire, all herclothing, and objects that could fit into a pocket areconcealed.Some things are beyond the power of Unseen Presence to conceal. Although the character is cloakedfrom view while he smashes through a window, yellsout, or throws someone across the room, the vampirebecomes visible to all in the aftermath. Bystanders snapout of the subtle fugue in which Obfuscate put them.Worse still, each viewer can make a Wits + Awarenessroll (difficulty 7); if successful, the mental haze clearscompletely, so those individuals recall every move thecharacter made up until then as if he had been visiblethe entire time.

	3:Mask of a Thousand 

	*FacesThe vampire can influence the perception of others,causing them to see a face different from his. Although the Kindred’s physical form does not change, any observer who cannot sense the truth sees whomever thevampire wishes her to see.The vampire must have a firm idea of the visage hewishes to project. The primary decision is whether tocreate an imaginary face or to superimpose the featuresof another person. Manufactured features are oftenmore difficult to compose in believable proportions,but such a disguise is easier to maintain than having toimpersonate someone else. Of course, things get simpler if the Kindred borrows the face but doesn’t botherwith the personality.System: The player rolls Manipulation + Performance (difficulty 7) to determine how well the disguiseworks. If the character tries to impersonate someone,he must get a good look at the subject before puttingon the mask. The Storyteller may raise the difficulty ifthe character catches only a glimpse. The chart
 belowlists the degrees of success in manufacturing anotherappearance. Vampires wishing to mask themselves asa person more attractive than they are must pay additional blood points equal to the difference betweenthe vampire’s Appearance rating and the Appearanceof the mask (which means that younger vampires mayneed to take longer in order to spend the blood necessary).

		@1 success		The vampire retains the same heightand build, with a few slightalterations to his basic features.Nosferatu can appear as normal,albeit ugly, mortals.

		@2 successes		He looks unlike himself; people don’teasily recognize him or agree abouthis appearance.

		@3 successes		He looks the way he wants to appear.

		@4 successes		Complete transformation, includinggestures, mannerisms, appearance,and voice.

		@5 successes		Profound alteration (appear as theopposite sex, a vastly different age,or an extreme change of size).

	**Actually posing as someone else carries its own problems. The character should know at least basic information about the individual; especially difficult deceptions (fooling a lover or close friend) require at leastsome familiarity with the target in order to succeed.

	4:Vanish from the Mind’s Eye

	*This potent expression of Obfuscate enables thevampire to disappear from plain view. So profound isthis vanishing that the immortal can fade away even ifhe stands directly in front of someone.While the disappearance itself is quietly subtle, itsimpact on those who see it is anything but. Most kinepanic and flee in the aftermath. Especially weak-willedindividuals wipe the memory of the Kindred from theirminds. Although vampires are not shaken so easily,even Kindred may be momentarily surprised by a sudden vanishing.System: The player rolls Charisma + Stealth; thedifficulty equals the target’s Wits + Alertness (use thehighest total in the group if the character disappearsin front of a crowd). With three or fewer successes,the character fades but does not vanish, becoming anindistinct, ghostlike figure. With more than three, hedisappears completely. If the player scores more successes than an observer’s Willpower rating, that personforgets that the vampire was there in the first pl
ace.Tracking the character accurately while he appearsghostlike requires a Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 8). A successful roll means the individual caninteract normally with the vampire (although theKindred looks like a profoundly disturbing ghostlyshape). A failed roll results in a +2 difficulty modifier (maximum 10) when attempting to act upon, orinteract with, the vampire. The Storyteller may callfor new observation checks if the vampire moves to anenvironment in which he’s difficult to see (heads intoshadows, crosses behind an obstacle, proceeds througha crowd). When fully invisible, the vampire is handledas described under Unseen Presence, above. vokes the power gives himself away, the cloak fallsfrom everyone. This power is particularly useful if thevampire needs to bring his retinue through a secure location without drawing the notice of others.System: The character may conceal one extra individual for each dot of Stealth he possesses. He may bestow any single Obfus
cate power at a given time to thegroup. While the power applies to everyone under thecharacter’s cloak, his player need only make a singleroll. Each individual must follow the requirements described under the relevant Obfuscate power to remainunder its effect; any person who fails to do so loses thecloak’s protection, but doesn’t expose the others. Onlyif the vampire himself errs does the power drop for everyone.

	**A person subject to the vanishing makes a Wits +Courage roll (mortals at difficulty 9, vampires at difficulty 5). A successful roll means the individual reactsimmediately (although after the vampire performs hisaction for that turn); failure means the person standsuncomprehending for two turns while her mind tries tomake sense of what she just experienced.

	5:Cloak the Gathering

	*At this degree of power, the vampire may extendhis concealing abilities to cover an area. The immortal may use any Obfuscate power upon those nearby aswell as upon himself, if he wishes.Any protected person who compromises the cloakexposes himself to view. Further, if the one who in-

	6: Conceal

	*The vampire may mask an inanimate object up tothe size of a house (Obfuscate cannot be used to disguise inanimate objects without the use of this power).If the object is hidden, so are all of its contents. WhileConceal is in effect, passersby walk around the concealed object as if it were still visible, but refuse to acknowledge that they are making any kind of detour.System: In order to activate this power, a charactermust be within about 30 feet (approximately 10 meters) of the object to be concealed and the item musthold some personal significance for him. The Concealpower functions as Unseen Presence for purposes ofdetection, as well as the duration and durability of thedisguise.

	**Conceal can be used on a vehicle in which the character is traveling. In this instance, traffic patterns seemto flow around the vehicle, and accidents are actuallyless likely as other drivers subconsciously maneuveraway from the concealed auto. A police radar gun stillregisters a speeding car masked in this fashion, but theofficer behind the gun is disinclined to make a trafficstop of the phantom blip. Using Conceal on aircraftis problematic, as the power’s range generally doesn’textend far enough to cover air traffic controllers andthe like.

	6: Mind Blank

	*A vampire with this power is able to shrug off telepathic contact, easily withstanding invasive probes ofher mind.System: Any attempt to read or probe the character’smind first requires a successful Perception + Empathyroll (difficulty equal to the character’s Wits + Stealth).

	**Even if a potential intruder does succeed, his dice poolfor the attempt is then limited to the number of successes he scored on the initial roll.

	6: Soul Mask

	*In addition to concealing her form, a vampire whohas developed Soul Mask is able to conceal her aura.She may display whatever combination of colors andshades she wishes, or may appear to have no aura whatsoever. This power is of particular use to those of elderGeneration who have reached such heights of powerthrough diablerie.System: The use of this power allows the projection of only one aura (or lack thereof) — the vampirechooses the precise colors to be displayed when she firstdevelops Soul Mask. If the character has no experiencewith the use of Aura Perception, she may not choosean alternate aura, as she has no idea what one wouldlook like, though she can still choose to display no aurawhatsoever. Soul Mask can be bought multiple times,if desired, in order to give a vampire multiple alternateauras from which to choose.Unless the player states otherwise, Soul Mask is always in effect. If the character has bought Soul Masktwo or more times, her “default” aura displayed is th
efirst one she learned.

	7: Cache

	*Most Obfuscate powers require the individual usingthem to be within a short distance of the subjects ofthe concealment. Cache extends this range considerably, allowing an elder with this power to leave peopleor objects safely hidden while he goes about his business elsewhere.System: A character must be within the normal required distance to initiate an Obfuscate power. Oncethis is done, the player spends a Willpower point, whichactivates Cache on top of the already functioning useof the Discipline. The concealment will now remainin effect as long as the vampire is within a distanceequal to his Wits + Stealth in miles (or one and halftimes that in kilometers) from the object or person hewishes to conceal. The enhanced concealment fades atthe next sunrise, or breaks (as always) if the Obfuscatesubject reveals himself.

	7:Veil of Blissful Ignorance

	*This power’s development is attributed to the Malkavians, but many Nosferatu have also found it to behighly useful. The Veil of Blissful Ignorance allows a vampire to Obfuscate an unwilling victim, removinghim from the notice of others. Some Nosferatu use thispower to teach a humbling lesson to individuals whotake the presence and aid of others for granted, whileothers utilize it to remove an essential member of agroup in the midst of a crisis.System: The character must touch the victim to activate this power. The player spends a blood point androlls Wits + Stealth (difficulty equals the victim’s Appearance + 3). If the roll is a success, the victim is subject to the effects of Vanish From the Mind’s Eye for alength of time determined by the number of successesthe player rolls.

		@1 success		Three turns

		@2 successes		One minute (20 turns)

		@3 successes		15 minutes

		@4 successes		One hour

		@5 successes		One night

	**The victim of Veil of Blissful Ignorance does not necessarily know that he is under the effect of this power.He is only aware that everyone around him has suddenly begun acting as if he were not there. The victimcannot break this effect, even with violence; if he attacks someone, the target ascribes the act to the visibleindividual nearest to him. More than one fatal brawlhas been incited by this side-effect. The Veil persistseven if the vampire who activated it leaves the area.Curiously enough, Veil of Blissful Ignorance cannever be used on anyone who is ready and willing toaccept its effects.

	8:Old Friend

	*Many elder Nosferatu have made reputations for omniscience with the secrets they learn through creativeuses of this power. A variation of Mask of a ThousandFaces, Old Friend allows a vampire to probe a subject’ssubconscious and take the semblance of the individualwhom that victim trusts over anyone else. Someoneusing this power does not appear as someone who thevictim is frightened of or awed by, but rather someoneto whom the victim feels comfortable revealing intimate secrets. Old Friend doesn’t necessarily make itsuser appear as someone who is still among the living; along- dead friend or relative is just as likely, and in suchcases the subject remembers the encounter as a dreamor a ghostly visitation.

	**System: The player rolls Manipulation + Subterfuge(difficulty equal to the victim’s Perception + Alertness or Awareness, maximum 10). The more successes,the more convincing the impersonation. This poweronly affects one victim at a time; other observers seethe vampire as she truly is, unless she also establishesa Mask of a Thousand Faces in addition to using OldFriend.

	9:Create Name

	*Some Toreador call this power the ultimate development of method acting. Create Name allows a character to create a completely new identity; face, speechpattern, aura, even thought processes are constructedaccording to the vampire’s desired identity. The powercan be used to impersonate an existing individual, orit can project the semblance of a completely fictionalidentity with perfect accuracy.System: A vampire working with Create Name mustspend three hours a night in relatively uninterruptedquiet to establish a new personality by means of thispower. The player makes an extended roll of Intelligence + Subterfuge (difficulty 8), one roll per night. Atotal of 20 successes are necessary to construct a newidentity, while a botch removes five successes from thevampire’s total. Once a new identity has been successfully created, however, the character can step into it atany time without any sort of roll. Any outside observerwithout Auspex 9 or the equivalent sees the artificialidentit
y. The character’s face, aura, Nature, Demeanor,even thoughts and Psychological Merits and Flaws allappear to be those of the persona selected and craftedby the character.The only way to pierce this disguise, other than Auspex 9, is to notice any discrepancies between the assumed identity and the Abilities it logically ought topossess. A character with no dots in Medicine shouldhave a hard time pulling off a created identity as a neurosurgeon, for example. The Storyteller should make asecret roll of Perception + Alertness (difficulty 9) foreach character who should catch a slip made by theimpostor.



--Obtenebration

	*The signature power of the Lasombra, Obtenebration grants the vampire power over darkness itself. Thenature of the darkness invoked by Obtenebration isa matter of intense debate among Kindred. Some believe it to be merely shadows, while others feel that the power gives control over the stuff of the vampire’s soul,coaxing it tangibly outward.Regardless, the effects of Obtenebration are terrifying, as waves of darkness roil out from the Cainite, enveloping those in their path like an infernal wave. AsObtenebration is mostly known as a Sabbat Discipline,any Camarilla vampire caught using the power hadbetter have a damned good explanation.Note: Vampires using Obtenebration can see throughthe darkness they control, though other vampires (eventhose that also have Obtenebration) cannot. Dreadfultales of rival Lasombra struggling to blind and smothereach other with the same wisps of darkness circulateamong young members of the Clan, though no eldershave come forth to substantiate these cl
aims.

	1:Shadow Play

	*This power grants the vampire limited control overshadows and other ambient darkness. Though the vampire cannot truly “create” darkness, she can overlap andstretch existing shadows, creating patches of gloom.This power also allows Kindred to separate shadowsfrom their casting bodies and even shape darkness intothe shadows of things that are not there.Once a Kindred takes control of darkness or shadow,it gains a mystical tangibility. By varying accounts coldor hellishly hot and cloying, the darkness may be usedto aggravate or even smother victims. Certain callousLasombra claim to have choked mortals to death withtheir own shadows.System: This power requires no roll, but a bloodpoint must be spent to activate it. Shadow Play lasts forone scene and requires no active concentration. Kindred cloaking themselves in shadow gain an extra diein their Stealth dice pools and add one to the difficulties of ranged weapon attacks against them. Vampireswho use the darkness to make themselves m
ore terrifying add one die to Intimidation dice pools. Opponentsplagued by flapping shadows and strangling darknesssubtract one die from all Stamina dice pools (including soak). Mortals, ghouls, and other air-breathers reduced to zero Stamina by strangling shadows begin toasphyxiate; vampires lose all appropriate dice but areotherwise unaffected. Only one target or subject maybe affected by this power at any given time, thoughsome modicum of concealment is offered to a relativelymotionless group.The unnatural appearance of this power proves extremely disconcerting to mortals and animals (and, atthe Storyteller’s discretion, Kindred who have never seen it before). Whenever this power is invoked withina mortal’s vicinity, that individual must make a Courage roll (difficulty 8) or suffer a one-die penalty to alldice pools for the remainder of the scene, due to fear ofthe monstrous shadows.

	2:Shroud of Night

	*The vampire can create a cloud of inky blackness.The cloud completely obscures light and even soundto some extent. Those who have been trapped withinit (and survived) describe the cloud as viscous and unnerving. This physical manifestation lends credence tothose Lasombra who claim that their darkness is something other than mere shadow.The tenebrous cloud may even move, if the creatingKindred wishes, though this requires complete concentration.System: The player rolls Manipulation + Occult(difficulty 7). Success on the roll generates darknessroughly 10 feet (three meters) in diameter, thoughthe amorphous cloud constantly shifts and undulates,sometimes even extending shadowy tendrils. Eachadditional success doubles the diameter of the cloud(though the vampire may voluntarily reduce the areashe wishes to cover). The cloud may be invoked ata distance of up to 50 yards/meters, though creatingdarkness outside the vampire’s line of sight adds twoto the difficulty of the roll and require
s a blood point’sexpenditure.The tarry mass actually extinguishes light sources itengulfs (with the exception of fire), and muffles soundsuntil they are indistinguishable. Those within thecloud lose all sense of sight and feel as though they’vebeen immersed in pitch. Sound also warps and distortswithin the cloud, making it nearly impossible to accomplish anything (+2 difficulty, as per Blind Fighting on p. 274). Even those possessed of HeightenedSenses, Eyes of the Beast, Tongue of the Asp, and similar powers suffer the penalty for blindness due to theunnatural darkness. Additionally, being surrounded bythe Shroud of Night reduces Stamina-based dice poolsby two dice, as the murk smothers and agitates the victims. This effect is not cumulative with Shadow Play,although targets asphyxiate as per Shadow Play if theyreach 0 Stamina; more than one unfortunate mortalhas “drowned” in darkness.Mortals and animals surrounded by the Shroudof Night must make Courage rolls per Shadow Play
,above, or panic and flee.

	3:Arms of the Abyss

	*Refining his control over darkness, the Kindred cancreate prehensile tentacles that emerge from patches ofdim lighting. These tentacles may grasp, restrain, andconstrict foes.

	**System: The player spends a blood point and makesa simple (never extended) Manipulation + Occult roll(difficulty 7); each success enables the creation of asingle tentacle. Each tentacle is six feet (two meters)long and possesses Strength and Dexterity ratings equalto the invoking vampire’s Obtenebration Trait — Potence and Celerity dots are added to these Strength andDexterity ratings, respectively. If the vampire chooses,she may spend a blood point either to increase a singletentacle’s Strength or Dexterity by one or to extend itslength by another six feet or two meters. Each tentaclehas four health levels, is affected by fire and sunlightas if it were a vampire, and soaks bashing and lethaldamage using the vampire’s Stamina + Fortitude. Aggravated damage may not be soaked.

	**Tentacles may constrict foes, inflicting (Strength +1)lethal damage per turn. Breaking the grasp of a tentacle requires the victim to win a resisted Strength rollagainst the tentacle (difficulty 6 for each). However,tentacles cannot be used for any kind of manipulation,such as typing or driving.All tentacles need not emanate from the same source— so long as there are multiple patches of suitabledarkness, there are sources for the Arms of the Abyss.Controlling the tentacles does not require completeconcentration; if the Kindred is not incapacitated orin torpor, she may control tentacles while carrying outother actions.

	4:Black Metamorphosis

	*The Cainite calls upon his inner darkness and infuses himself with it, becoming a monstrous hybrid ofmatter and shadow. His body becomes mottled withspots of tenebrous shade, and wispy tentacles extrudefrom his torso and abdomen. Though still humanoid,the vampire takes on an almost demonic appearance,as the darkness within him bubbles to the surface.System: The player spends two blood points andmakes a Manipulation + Courage roll (difficulty 7) —vampires of lower Generation may have to take twoturns to make the transition. Failure indicates the vampire cannot undergo the Black Metamorphosis (thoughhe spends the blood points nonetheless). A botch inflicts two unsoakable health levels of lethal damage onthe vampire as darkness ravages his undead body.

	**While under the effects of the Black Metamorphosis,the vampire possesses four tentacles similar to thoseevoked via Arms of the Abyss (though their Strengthand Dexterity ratings are equal to the vampire’s ownAttributes, including dice from Celerity and Potence).These tentacles, combined with the bands of darknessall over the Kindred’s body, subtract two dice from theStamina and soak dice pools of opponents physicallytouched in combat, for as long as the vampire remainsin contact with the victim. This is not cumulativewith other powers in Obtenebration, although targetscan asphyxiate at Stamina 0, as per Shadow Play. Thevampire may make an additional attack without penalty by using the tentacles (for a total of two attacks,not one additional attack per tentacle). Additionally,the vampire can sense his surroundings fully even inpitch darkness.The vampire’s head and extremities sometimes appear to fade away into nothingness, while at othertimes they seem swathed in otherworldly d
arkness.This, combined with the wriggling tentacles writhingfrom his body, creates an unsettling sight. Mortals, animals, and other creatures not accustomed to this sortof display must make Courage rolls (difficulty 8) or succumb to a panic that amounts to Rötschreck (thoughit is inspired by the darkness rather than fire). ManyKindred cultivate this devilish aspect, and the BlackMetamorphosis adds three dice to the invoking Kindred’s Intimidation dice pools.

	5:Tenebrous Form

	*At this level, the Kindred’s mastery of darkness is soextensive that she may physically become it. Upon activation of this power, the vampire becomes an inky,amoeboid patch of shadow. Vampires in this form arepractically invulnerable and may slither through cracksand crevices. In addition, the shadow-vampire gainsthe ability to see in natural darkness.System: The transformation costs three blood points(which may need to occur over three turns, depending on the vampire’s Generation). The vampire is immune to physical attacks while in the tenebrous form(though she still takes aggravated damage from fire andsunlight), but may not herself physically attack. Shemay, however, envelop and ooze over others, affecting them in the same manner as a Shroud of Night,in addition to using mental Disciplines. Vampires inTenebrous Form may even slither up walls and across ceilings or “drip” darkness upward — they have nomass and are thus unaffected by gravity. Rötschreckdifficulties from 
fire and sunlight do increase by one forvampires in this form, as the light is even more painfulto their shadowy bodies.Mortals (and others not used to such displays) whowitness the vampire transform into unholy shadow require Courage rolls (difficulty 8) in order to avoid the debilitating terror described under Black Metamorphosis.

	6: The Darkness Within

	*This power allows the Cainite to call forth the darkness contained in her black soul. This enormous, turbulent shadow vomits from the vampire’s mouth, thoughsome vampires are said to cut themselves and let theblackness seep from their veins. The shadow-cloud engulfs a chosen target, burning it with a soul-scarringchill and siphoning its blood away in torrents.System: The player makes a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) and spends a blood point. The resulting shadowenvelops the target and, though it does not physicallyharm the victim, it may strike terror into him. Individuals observing the Darkness Within, whether as targets or onlookers, may suffer from the terror describedunder Black Metamorphosis, unless they are alreadyfamiliar with the Kindred’s power.Individuals touched by The Darkness Within lose onepoint of blood per turn, though targets may resist this effect by succeeding on a Stamina roll (difficulty 6) eachturn the target remains in contact with the cloud.The Cainite inv
oking The Darkness Within mustdevote all her attention to maintaining the cloud. Ifthe vampire is attacked, the darkness immediately returns to her through whatever orifice it originated. TheCainite can summon the darkness back at any time,gaining a number of blood points equal to one-half thenumber the shadow siphoned from its victims (roundup). Taking blood from another in this fashion is similar to drinking from that vampire, and blood bondsmay result. Additionally, the Darkness Within maytake blood from only one individual per turn, though itmay be in contact with many.

	6: Shadowstep

	*The vampire has such fine control over the darknessthat he may become it briefly and reform himself fromother darkness close by. The vampire may Shadowstepthrough walls, floors, and even mystical barriers. TheCainite simply steps “into” a shadow and re-emerges from another shadow a short distance away (or next tothe barrier, if there is no shadow on the other side).System: The player rolls Dexterity + Occult, and ona successful roll, the character may emerge from another shadow no more than 50 feet (or 15 meters) away.Failing the roll means simply that the character cannotstep through the shadow-realm, while a botch signifies the character has become trapped between shadows (which fiendish Storytellers should have a heydaywith). Pulling another individual through the shadowrequires a Strength + Occult roll, with consequencesfor failure similar to failing by oneself.

	7: Shadow Twin

	*The vampire’s control over darkness has progressedto such a degree that he may bestow upon it a limited degree of sentience. By animating his own shadowor that of another, the Cainite can actually “free” theshadow cast by light. While this power is active, thesubject casts no shadow, as it has left to pursue thevampire’s commands.This power can unnerve mortals and even a few inexperienced vampires. The Kindred wielding Obtenebration commands the individual’s shadow; some vampiresreport having seen mortals literally scared to death, astheir shadows leapt away to taunt or menace them.System: The player spends a blood point and makesa Willpower roll (difficulty 8). If the roll succeeds, theshadow springs to unholy freedom for one hour persuccess (though it disappears at sunrise regardless ofhow many successes the vampire had). The ShadowTwin has Attribute and Ability ratings equal to halfthose of its parent body; they won’t do much talkingor thinking, so Mental and Social T
raits don’t mattermuch, though Wits may come into play. Additionally,the Shadow Twin has an Obtenebration score equalto one-half of that of the vampire who animated it(rounded down). Mortals and vampires unused to Obtenebration require a Courage roll upon witnessingthis, as per Shadow Play.The twin may separate itself from the parent andtravel up to 50 feet or 15 meters away, crawlingthrough crevices or sliding up walls. It may attack andbe attacked, though it takes and does only half damage (again, round down). Flame and supernatural attacks (such as vampire fangs, mystical powers, etc.) dofull damage. If the Shadow Twin is killed, its parentloses half her Willpower points and must roll to avoidRötschreck (difficulty 9).

	8: Oubliette

	*By creating a “chamber” of pure darkness, the Cainite may entrap or smother her enemies. No air existsin this shadow-trap, and mortals suffocate within itschilling void. Even vampires have little recourse oncetrapped — they may leave only at their captor’s whim.The Oubliette appears as a dense patch of shadow, unaffected by ambient light around it.System: The vampire spends a blood point, but noroll is necessary to create the Oubliette. To actuallycreate the Oubliette around someone requires a contested Wits + Larceny roll against the target’s Dexterity+ Occult (difficulty 7 for both rolls). Mortals suffocatewithin a number of minutes equal to their Stamina(though the Lasombra may choose to leave their headsexposed or trap a quantity of air inside as well), whilevampires are simply suspended impotently in darknessand may not use Disciplines or take other actions. TheOubliette vanishes instantly when touched by sunlight— which has left more than one vampire exposed to the
sun’s unforgiving rays — or when the Kindred choosesto relax it. A vampire may maintain only one Oublietteat a time (which can only contain one target at a time),which leads some Cainite philosophers to argue that itis a prison created from the vampire’s very soul.

	9:Ahriman’s Demesne

	*This power allows the vampire to summon a darkness so oppressive that it extinguishes the light of life— or unlife — of any victim trapped within it. Ahriman’s Demesne creates a 50-foot (or 15-meter) radiusof void that issues from the Cainite’s hand and takesaway the bodies of those it claims when it vanishes.The overwhelming darkness destroys friend and foealike, claiming anyone unfortunate enough to be within its circumference.System: The player spends two points of Willpowerand concentrates for three turns. During this time, theblackness billows out of the character’s hand, growingto fill the area. At the end of the third turn, the playerrolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty 6). Everyonein the darkness’ area suffers that many health levels ofdamage (aggravated, if the victims are vampires) outright — six successes yield six levels of damage, notsix dice of damage. After Ahriman’s Demesne does itsdamage, it collapses, taking with it the bodies of anywho died when
 they came in contact with the dreadfulshadow.



--Potence

	*Kindred endowed with Potence possess unnatural strength. This Discipline enables vampire to leapmassive distances, lift tremendous weights, and strikeopponents with brutal force. Even low ranks of thispower can give Kindred physical power beyond mortal bounds. More powerful Kindred can leap so far thatthey appear to be flying, toss cars like soda cans, andpunch through walls like cardboard. While the moresubtle mental Disciplines can be awe-inspiring, thebrutal effectiveness of Potence is formidable in its ownright.The Brujah, Giovanni, Lasombra, and Nosferatu arenaturally gifted with this Discipline, but members ofother Clans often make a point to find someone whocan teach them the awesome power of Potence.System: Each dot that the vampire has in Potenceadds one die to all Strength-related dice rolls. Further,the player can spend one blood point and change hisPotence dice into an equal number of automatic successes to all Strength-related rolls for the turn. In melee and brawling c
ombat, successes from Potence (either rolled or automatic) are applied to the damage rollresults.Potence 6+While flesh and blood have their limits, undead sinews and vitae have a bit more latitude when it comesto feats of strength. Vampires who are close to Caine indescent are sometimes capable of strength-based maneuvers that awe even other vampires. A product ofblood and will as much as of muscle and bone, masteryof Potence gives a vampire the ability to do far morethan just lift progressively heavier objects — if thevampire himself is willing to learn an alternate way.Advanced Potence powers can be purchased in thesame fashion as advanced Celerity or Fortitude powers:A character can choose to learn an alternate power instead of advancing along the Discipline’s normal progression, and can later go back and re-purchase whathe’s missed.

	6: Imprint

	*A vampire with extensive knowledge of Potence cansqueeze very, very hard. As a matter of fact, she cansqueeze (or press, or push) so hard that she can leavean imprint of her fingers or hand in any hard surfaceup to and including solid steel. A use of Imprint can simply serve as a threat, or it can be used, for example,to dig handholds into sheer surfaces for purposes ofclimbing.System: Imprint requires a point of blood to activate.The power remains active for the duration of a scene.The depth of the imprint the vampire creates with Imprint is up to the Storyteller — decisions should takeinto account how much force the vampire can bring tobear, the toughness of the material, and its thickness.If the object the vampire grasps is thin enough, at theStoryteller’s discretion, the vampire might simply beable to push through it (in the case of a wall) or tear itoff (in the case of a spear or pipe).

	7: Earthshock

	*According to some pundits, Potence is merely theart of hitting something very hard. But what do youdo when your target is too far away to hit directly? Theanswer is, if you’re sufficiently talented with the Discipline, to employ Earthshock. On its simplest level,Earthshock is the ability to hit the ground at point A,and subsequently have the force of the blow emergefrom the ground at point B.System: The use of Earthshock requires the expenditure of two blood points, as well as a normal Dexterity+ Brawl roll. The vampire punches or stamps on theground, and, if the attack is a success, the force of theblow emerges from the ground as a geyser of stone andearth directly underneath the target. The attack can bedodged at a +2 difficulty.Earthshock’s range is 10 feet or three meters for every level of Potence the vampire has, up to the limitsof visibility. A failure on the attack roll means thatthe strike goes errant and is liable to explode anywherewithin range; a botch means that the
 vampire pulverizes the ground beneath him and may well bury himselfin the process.

	8: Flick

	*It is a truism that “the great ones always make it lookeasy.” In the case of Flick, that saying stops being atruism and becomes literal truth. With this power, amaster of Potence can make the slightest gesture — awave, a snap of the fingers, the toss of a ball — andhave it unleash the full, devastating impact of a deadon strike. The attack can come without warning, limiting the target’s ability to dodge or anticipate; this makesFlick one of the most feared applications of Potence.System: Flick costs a point of blood, and requiresa Dexterity + Brawl roll (difficulty 6). The vampire must also make some sort of gesture directing the blow.What the gesture is remains up to the player — anything from a snap of the fingers to a blown kiss hasworked in the past.Flick‘s range is equal to the limit of the Kindred’sperception, and the blow struck does damage equal toa normal punch (including all bonuses).



--Presence

	*Presence is the Discipline of emotional manipulation. Vampires with this power can inspire passionatefervor or unreasoning terror in mortals and Kindredalike. In addition, unlike most Disciplines, some ofPresence’s powers can be used on entire crowds at onetime. Presence can transcend race, religion, gender,class, and (most importantly) supernatural nature. Assuch, this subtle power is one of the most useful Disciplines a vampire can possess.Anyone can resist Presence for one scene by spending a Willpower point and succeeding on a Willpowerroll (difficulty 8), but the affected individual must keepspending points until he is no longer in the presenceof the vampire (or, in the case of Summon, until theeffect wears off). Vampires three or more Generationslower than the wielder need only spend a single Willpower to ignore the Presence for an entire night andneed not roll Willpower to do so.The major drawback of Presence is that it controlsonly the emotions. It causes others to feel a 
certainway toward the vampire, but does not give her outrightcontrol over them. While people weigh strongly theorders that the vampire declares, their minds are stilltheir own. Suicidal or ridiculous directives don’t soundany more sensible just because the person giving themis unusually fascinating. Still, inspired eloquence orsignificant wealth used in combination with this Discipline can enable the vampire to urge others along adesired course.The Brujah, Followers of Set, Toreador, and VentrueClans are all adept in this Discipline. The Ventrue arearguably the most skilled with its application, however,due to their ability to use Presence and Dominate inefficient combination.

	1:Awe

	*Those near the vampire suddenly desire to be closerto her and become receptive to her point of view. Aweis extremely useful for mass communication. It matters little what is said — the hearts of those affected leantoward the vampire’s opinion. The weak want to agreewith her; even if the strong-willed resist, they soonfind themselves outnumbered. Awe can turn a chancydeliberation into a certain resolution in the vampire’sfavor almost before her opponents know that the tidehas turned.Despite the intensity of this attraction, those so smitten do not lose their sense of self-preservation. Dangerbreaks the spell of fascination, as does leaving the area.Those subject to Awe will remember how they felt inthe vampire’s presence, however. This will influencetheir reactions should they ever encounter her again.System: The player spends a blood point and rollsCharisma + Performance (difficulty 7). The number ofsuccesses rolled determines how many people are affected, as noted on the ch
art below. If there are morepeople present than the character can influence, Aweaffects those with lower Willpower ratings first. Thepower stays in effect for the remainder of the scene oruntil the character chooses to drop it.

		@1 success		One person

		@2 successes		Two people

		@3 successes		Six people

		@4 successes		20 people

		@5 successes		Everyone in the vampire’s immediatevicinity (an entire auditorium, a mob)

	**Those affected can use Willpower points to overcomethe effect, but must continue spending Willpower every scene for as long as they remain in the same area asthe vampire. As soon as an individual spends a numberof Willpower points equal to the successes rolled, heshakes off the Awe completely and remains unaffectedfor the rest of the night.

	2:Dread Gaze

	*While all Kindred can frighten others by physicallyrevealing their true vampiric natures — baring clawsand fangs, glaring with malevolence, hissing loudly withmalice — this power focuses these elements to insanelyterrifying levels. Dread Gaze engenders unbearable terror in its victim, stupefying him into madness, immobility, or reckless flight. Even the most stalwart individualwill fall back from the vampire’s horrific visage.System: The player rolls Charisma + Intimidation(difficulty equal to the victim’s Wits + Courage). Success indicates the victim is cowed, while failure meansthe target is startled but not terrified by the sight. Threeor more successes means he runs away in abject fear;victims who have nowhere to run claw at the walls,hoping to dig a way out rather than face the vampire.Moreover, each success subtracts one from the target’saction dice pools next turn.The character may attempt Dread Gaze once per turnagainst a single target, though she may also perform 
itas an extended action, adding her successes in order tosubjugate the target completely. Once the target losesenough dice that he cannot perform any action, he’s soshaken and terrified that he curls up on the ground andweeps. Failure during the extended action means theattempt falters. The character loses all her collectedsuccesses and can start over next turn, while the victimmay act normally again.A botch at any time indicates the target is not at allimpressed — perhaps even finding the vampire’s anticscomical — and remains immune to any further uses ofPresence by the character for the rest of the story.

	3:Entrancement

	*This power bends others’ emotions, making themthe vampire’s willing servants. Due to what these individuals see as true and enduring devotion, they heedthe vampire’s every desire. Since this is done willingly,instead of having their wills sapped, these servants retain their creativity and individuality.While these obedient minions are more personableand spirited than the mind-slaves created by Dominate, they’re also somewhat unpredictable. Further,since Entrancement is of a temporary duration, dealingwith a lapsed servant can be troublesome. A wise Kindred either disposes of those she Entrances after theyserve their usefulness, or binds them more securely by ablood bond (made much easier by the minion’s willingness to serve).System: The player spends a blood point and rollsAppearance + Empathy (difficulty equal to the target’scurrent Willpower points); the number of successesdetermines how long the subject is Entranced, as perthe chart below. (Subjects can still spend Wi
llpower totemporarily resist, like any other Presence power.) TheStoryteller may wish to make the roll instead, since thecharacter is never certain of the strength of her holdon the victim. The vampire may try to keep the subjectunder her thrall, but can do so only after the initialEntrancement wears off. Attempting this power whileEntrancement is already in operation has no effect.

		@-1 success			Subject cannot be entrancedfor the rest of the story.

		@0 success		Subject cannot be entrancedfor the rest of the night.

		@1 success		One hour

		@2 successes		One day

		@3 successes		One week

		@4 successes		One month

		@5 successes		One year

	4:Summon

	*This impressive power enables the vampire to call toherself any person whom she has ever met. This callcan go to anyone, mortal or supernatural, across anydistance within the physical world. The subject of theSummons comes as fast as he is able, possibly withouteven knowing why. He knows intuitively how to findhis Summoner — even if the vampire moves to a newlocation, the subject redirects his own course as soonas he can. After all, he’s coming to the vampire herself,not to some predetermined site.Although this power allows the vampire to call someone across a staggering distance, it is most useful whenused locally. Even if the desired person books the nextavailable flight, getting to Kyoto from Milwaukee canstill take far longer than the vampire needs. Obviously,the individual’s financial resources are a factor; if hedoesn’t have the money to travel quickly, it will takehim a far greater time to get there.The subject thinks mainly of reaching the vampire,but does not neglec
t his own well-being. This is lessof a consideration if he only has to cross a room, unless he must get through a gang of gun-wielding punksto do so. The individual retains his survival instincts,and while he won’t shirk physical violence to reachthe vampire’s side, he won’t subject himself to suicidalsituations.The Summoning dissipates at dawn. Unless the subject is trained to continue toward the vampire after thefirst call, the immortal must Summon each night untilthe target arrives. Still, as long as the vampire is willing and able, she is assured to greet her desired subjectsome night — as long as nothing happens to him alongthe way, of course.System: The player spends a blood point and rollsCharisma + Subterfuge. The base difficulty is 5; this increases to difficulty 7 if the subject was met only briefly.If the character used Presence successfully on the targetin the past, this difficulty drops to 4, but if the attemptwas unsuccessful, the difficulty rises to 8.The number
 of successes indicates the subject’s speedand attitude in responding:

		@-1 success			Subject cannot be Summoned bythat vampire for the rest of the story.

		@0 success		Subject cannot be Summoned by thatvampire for the rest of the night.

		@1 success		Subject approaches slowlyand hesitantly.

		@2 successes		Subject approaches reluctantly andis easily thwarted by obstacles.

		@3 successes		Subject approaches withreasonable speed.

		@4 successes		Subject comes with haste,overcoming any obstacles inhis way.

		@5 successes		Subject rushes to the vampire, doinganything to get to her.

	5:Majesty

	*At this stage, the vampire can augment her supernatural mien a thousandfold. The attractive becomeparalyzingly beautiful; the homely become hideouslytwisted. Majesty inspires universal respect, devotion, fear — or all those emotions at once — in thosearound the vampire. The weak scramble to obey herevery whim, and even the most dauntless find it almostimpossible to deny her.People affected find the vampire so formidable thatthey dare not risk her displeasure. Raising their voicesto her is difficult; raising a hand against her is unthinkable. Those few who shake off the vampire’s potentmystique enough to oppose her are shouted down bythe many under her thrall, before the immortal needeven respond.Under Majesty’s influence, hearts break, power trembles, and the bold shake. Wise Kindred use this powerwith caution against mortal and immortal alike. WhileMajesty can cow influential politicians and venerable Primogen, the vampire must be careful that doing so doesn’tcome back to
 haunt her. After all, a dignitary brought low before others loses his usefulness quickly, while a humiliated Kindred has centuries to plan revenge.System: No roll is required on the part of the vampire, but she must spend a Willpower point. A subjectmust make a Courage roll (difficulty equal to the vampire’s Charisma + Intimidation, to a maximum of 10) ifhe wishes to be rude or simply contrary to the vampire.Success allows the individual to act normally for themoment, although he feels the weight of the vampire’sdispleasure crushing down on him. A subject who failsthe roll aborts his intended action and even goes toabsurd lengths to humble himself before the vampire,no matter who else is watching. The effects of Majestylast for one scene.

	6: Love

	*The blood bond is one of the most powerful tools inan elder’s inventory. However, more and more childerare aware of how to avoid being bound, so alternatives are needed. The Presence power called Love isone such alternative, as it simulates the effects of thebond without any of the messy side effects. While notas sure a method of control as a true blood bond, noras long-lasting, Love is still an extremely potent meansof command.System: The player spends a blood point and rollsCharisma + Subterfuge (difficulty equal to the target’scurrent Willpower points). Success on the roll indicates that the victim feels as attached to the characteras if he were blood bound to her. Each success also reduces the victim’s dice pool by one die for any Socialrolls to be made against the character. A botch makesthe target immune to all of the character’s Presencepowers for the rest of the night. This power lasts forone scene and can be applied to the same victim overmultiple scenes in the same
 night.

	6: Paralyzing Glance

	*Some elders have honed their mastery of Dread Gazeto such a degree that they are said to be able to paralyze with a look. The power‘s name is something of amisnomer, as victims of this power are not preciselyparalyzed in a physical sense, but rather frozen withsheer terror.System: The character must make eye contact(p. 152) with her intended victim. The player thenrolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty equal tothe target’s current Willpower points). Success rendersthe victim so terrified that he falls into a whimpering,catatonic state, unable to take any actions except curling into a fetal position and gibbering incoherently.The condition lasts for a length of time determined bythe number of successes rolled. If the victim’s life is directly threatened (by assault, impending sunrise, etc.),the poor wretch may attempt to break out of his paralysis with a Courage roll (difficulty equal to the character’s Intimidation + 3). One success ends the paralysis.A botch sends th
e victim into a continuous state ofRötschreck for the rest of the night.

		@1 success		Three turns

		@2 successes		Five minutes

		@3 successes		Remainder of the scene

		@4 successes		One hour

		@5 successes		Rest of the night

		@6+ successes 		A week (or more, at Storyteller discretion)

	6: Spark of Rage

	*A vampire possessing this power can shorten tempers and bring old grudges and irritations to the boilingpoint with a minimum of effort. Spark of Rage causesdisagreements and fights, and can even send othervampires into frenzy.System: The player spends a blood point and rollsManipulation + Subterfuge (difficulty 8). The number of individuals affected is determined by how manysuccesses are rolled. If this power is used in a crowd,those affected are the people in closest proximity tothe character. A vampire affected by this power mustspend a Willpower point or roll Self-Control/Instinct(difficulty equal to the character’s Manipulation +Subterfuge); failure sends the target into a frenzy. Abotch by the vampire using Spark of Rage sends theinvoking character into immediate frenzy.

		@1 success		Two people

		@2 successes		Four people

		@3 successes		Eight people

		@4 successes		20 people

		@5 successes		Everyone in the character’simmediate vicinity

	7: Cooperation

	*Any elder knows that Kindred are the most difficultbeings in existence to force to work together. Peacefulcoexistence is not a common tenet of vampiric society.With that in mind, this power can be used to nudgethose affected by it into a fragile spirit of camaraderie.Some cynical (or realistic) Ventrue claim that theirClan’s mastery of this Presence effect is the sole reasonthat anything is ever accomplished in Camarilla conclaves. Ventrue who voice this opinion too loudly alsotend to have numerous chances to test just how effective Cooperation is.System: To invoke Cooperation, the player spends ablood point and rolls Charisma + Leadership (difficulty8). The number of individuals affected is determined byhow many successes the player rolls. Cooperation lastsfor the remainder of the scene in which it is invoked,though particularly strong users of Presence may createlonger-lasting feelings of non-aggression (at Storytellerdiscretion) by spending Willpower. While this poweris in effe
ct, all those under its influence are more favorably disposed toward one another and are more willingto extend trust or make cooperative plans.For the most part, players should simply roleplay Cooperation’s effects, but there are some concrete ramifications to the power‘s use. For example, Self-Control/Instinct difficulties to resist frenzy in response to insultsfrom within the target group are decreased by three,and certain Social Flaws may be decreased in impactfor the duration of Cooperation.

		@1 success		Two people

		@2 successes		Four people

		@3 successes		Eight people

		@4 successes		20 people

		@5 successes		Everyone in the character’simmediate vicinity

	8:Ironclad Command

	*Any individual can normally resist the powers ofPresence for a brief time through an effort of will. Someelder Toreador and Ventrue have developed such forceof personality that their powers of Presence cannot beresisted without truly heroic efforts.System: This power is always in effect once it hasbeen learned. A mortal may not spend Willpower to resist the character’s Presence (for purposes of this power,the definition of “mortal” does not include supernaturally active humans such as ghouls or those who possessTrue Faith). A supernatural being must roll Willpower(difficulty of the character’s Willpower + 2; difficultiesover 10 mean that the roll cannot even be attempted)the first time he attempts to spend a Willpower pointto overcome the character’s Presence. For the rest ofthe night, the maximum number of Willpower pointshe can spend to resist the vampire’s Presence powersis equal to the number of successes he rolled. A botchdoubles the character’s Presence dice pool
s against thehapless victim for the remainder of the night.

	9:Pulse of the City

	*A vampire who has developed her Presence to thisterrifying degree can control the emotional climate ofthe entire region around her, up to the size of a largecity. This power is always in effect on a low level, attuning those who dwell in the area to the Kindred’smood, but it can also be used to project a specific emotion into the minds of every being in the area. Pulseof the City affects residents much more strongly thantourists, and also has a significant impact on those individuals who might be elsewhere at the time but whostill have strong ties to the affected city.System: The character must be present in the city inquestion, and have at least a casual, personal knowledge of its streets and makeup (maps won’t help). Theplayer spends a Willpower point and rolls Charisma +Streetwise (difficulty 9, though specializations or Storyteller fiat may decrease this difficulty if the characteris intimately familiar with a particular city). The number of successes indicates how long mort
al residents areaffected by the particular emotion that the characterbroadcasts; visitors with no ties to the area and supernatural beings are affected for a duration one successstep lower. The character can choose to terminate thiseffect at any time before it expires.

		@1 success		One minute

		@2 successes		10 minutes

		@3 successes		One hour

		@4 successes		One day

		@5 successes		One week

	**Pulse of the City can be used by a character in torpor.

	

--Protean

	*Protean allows the Kindred the mystical ability tomanipulate his physical form. Some vampires believethe power stems from a heightened connection to thenatural world, while others consider it to be a magnification of the mark of Caine. Whatever its basis maybe, those that develop this Discipline can grow bestialclaws, take on the forms of bats and wolves, turn themselves into mist, and even meld into the very earth itself.Transformed Kindred can generally use other Disciplines — vampires in wolf form can still read auras andcommunicate with other animals, for example. However, the Storyteller may rule that certain Disciplinesmay not be used in specific situations. The Kindred’sclothes and personal possessions also change when hetransforms (presumably absorbed within his very substance), although armor and the like do not provideany benefit while transformed.Vampires cannot change or transform large objects orother beings; Protean is a personal expression of power.A Kindred who h
as been staked (thereby trapping hissoul within his body) cannot transform. Some vampires believe that those who have mastered the highestlevels of Protean can deny this limitation, however.The Gangrel Clan is well known for their mastery ofProtean, although other Kindred have learned some ofthis Discipline’s secrets from these bestial Cainites.

	1:Eyes of the Beast

	*The vampire sees perfectly well in pitch darkness,not requiring a light source to notice details in eventhe darkest basement or cave. The vampire’s Beast isevident in his red glowing eyes, a sight sure to disturbmost mortals.System: The character must declare his desire to callforth the Eyes. No roll is necessary, but the change requires a full turn to complete. While manifesting theEyes, the character suffers a +1 difficulty to all Socialrolls with mortals unless he takes steps to shield hiseyes (sunglasses are the simplest solution). (A vampirewithout this power who is immersed in total darknesssuffers blind-fighting penalties as per p. 274.)

	2:Feral Claws

	*The vampire’s nails transform into long, bestial claws.These talons are wickedly sharp, able to rend flesh withease and even carve stone and metal with little trouble. The Beast is prominent in the claws as well, makingthem fearsome weapons against other immortals. It’srumored that some Gangrel have modified this powerto change their vampiric fangs into vicious tusks.System: The claws grow automatically in response tothe character’s desire, and can grow from both handsand feet. The transformation requires the expenditureof a blood point, takes a single turn to complete, andlasts for a scene.The character attacks normally in combat, but theclaws inflict Strength + 1 aggravated damage. Othersupernaturals cannot normally soak this damage, although a power such as Fortitude may be used. Additionally, the difficulties of all climbing rolls are reducedby two.

	3:Earth Meld

	*One of the most prized powers within Protean,Earth Meld enables the vampire to become one withthe earth. The immortal literally sinks into the bareground, transmuting his substance to bond with theearth.Though a vampire can immerse himself fully into theground, he cannot move around within it. Further, itis impossible to meld into earth through another substance. Wood slats, blacktop, even artificial turf blocksEarth Meld’s effectiveness — then again, it’s a relatively simple matter for a vampire at this level of powerto grow claws and rip apart enough of the flooring toexpose the raw soil beneath.By interring himself in the ground, the vampire gainsfull protection from daylight when outdoors. It is alsothe method of choice for those Kindred who wish tosleep away the centuries; these vampires lock themselves in the earth’s embrace, gaining strength andpower as they rest. Superstitious and paranoid Kindredwhisper that thousands of Ancients sleep within theground and will awak
en when Gehenna arrives.While so interred, the vampire is in a transitionalstate between flesh and earth. His physical presenceexists between the physical world and the astral plane.As such, the vampire is difficult to sense, even throughsupernatural means. However, a disruption to the soilthat the immortal occupies, or to his presence on theastral realm, returns him immediately to the physicalworld (and to full wakefulness), showering dirt outward as his body displaces the soil.System: No roll is necessary, although the character must spend a blood point. Sinking into the earth is automatic and takes a turn to complete. The characterfalls into a state one step above torpor during this time,sensing his surroundings only distantly. The playermust make a Humanity or Path roll (difficulty 6) forthe character to rouse himself in response to dangerprior to his desired time of emergence.Since the character is in an in-between state, any attempts to locate him (catching his scent, scanning f
orhis aura, traveling astrally, and so on) are made at +2difficulty. Astral individuals cannot affect the vampiredirectly, instead meeting with a kind of spongy resistance as their hands pass through him. Similarly, digging in the material world encounters incredibly hardpacked earth, virtually as dense as stone.Attempts at violence upon the submerged vampirefrom either side return him to his physical nature, expelling the soil with which he bonded in a blindingspray (all Perception-based rolls are at +2 difficulty forthe turn). The character himself subtracts two fromhis initiative for the first turn after his restoration, dueto momentary disorientation. Once expelled from theearth, the vampire may act normally.

	4:Shape of the Beast

	*This endows the vampire with the legendary abilityto transform into a wolf or bat. A Kindred changedin this way is a particularly imposing representativeof the animal kingdom. Indeed, he is far superior tonormal animals, even ones possessed by Subsume theSpirit. He retains his own psyche and temperament,but can still call upon the abilities of the beast form— increased senses for the wolf and flight for the bat.Gangrel are reputed to change to other animal formsbetter suited to their environment — jackals in Africa,dholes in Asia, and even enormous rats in urban environments — a feat that other Clans learning Proteancannot seem to duplicate.System: The character spends one blood point to assume the desired shape. The transformation requiresthree turns to complete (spending additional bloodpoints reduces the time of transformation by one turnper point spent, to a minimum of one). The vampireremains in his beast form until the next dawn, unlesshe wishes to change back sooner.Whi
le in the animal’s shape, the vampire can use anyDiscipline he possesses except Necromancy, Serpentis, Thaumaturgy, or Vicissitude (as well as any othersthe Storyteller deems unavailable). Furthermore, eachform gives the character the abilities of that creature.In wolf form, the vampire’s teeth and claws inflict Strength + 1 aggravated damage, he can run at doublespeed, and the difficulties of all Perception rolls are reduced by two. In bat form, the vampire’s Strength is reduced to 1, but he can fly at speeds of up to 20 miles perhour, difficulties for all hearing-based Perception rollsare reduced by three, and attacks made against him areat +2 difficulty due to his small size.The Storyteller may allow Gangrel to assume a different animal shape, but should establish the naturalabilities it grants the character.

	5:Mist Form

	*This truly unsettling power enables the vampire toturn into mist. His physical shape disperses into a hazycloud, but one still subject entirely to the immortal’swill. He floats at a brisk pace and may slip under doors,through screens, down pipes, and through other tinyopenings. Although strong winds can blow the vampire from his chosen course, even hurricane-force windscannot disperse his mist shape.Some Kindred feel that this power is an expression ofthe vampire’s ultimate control over the material world,while others believe that it is the immortal’s soul mademanifest (damned though it may be).System: No roll is required, although a blood pointmust be spent. The transformation takes three turns tocomplete, although the character may reduce this timeby one turn for each additional blood point spent (toa minimum of one turn). Strong winds may buffet thecharacter, although Disciplines such as Potence maybe used to resist them. Vampires in Mist Form can perceive their surrounding
s normally, although they cannot use powers that require eye contact.The vampire is immune to all mundane physical attacks while in mist form, although supernatural attacksaffect him normally. Also, the vampire takes one fewerdie of damage from fire and sunlight. The character maynot attack others physically while in this state — thisincludes encountering another vampire in mist form.He may use Disciplines that do not require physicalsubstance, however.

	6: Earth Control

	*An Earth Melded character with this power is nolonger confined to the resting place she selected thenight before. She can pass through the ground as if itwere water, “swimming” through the earth itself. Someelders use this as a means of unobstructed and unobtrusive travel, while others find it a highly effective meansof maneuvering in combat.

	**System: This power is in effect whenever a characteris Earth Melded, with no additional roll or expenditurenecessary. While in the ground, a vampire can propelherself at half of her normal walking speed. She cannotsee, but gains a supernatural awareness of her underground surroundings out to a range of 50 yards or meters. Water, rock, tree roots, and cement all effectivelyblock her progress; she can only move through earthand substances of similar consistency, such as sand orfine gravel. If two or more vampires attempt to interact underground, only direct physical contact is possible. All damage dice pools in this case are halved,and dodge and parry attempts are at -2 difficulty. Ifan underground chase takes place, it is resolved withan extended, contested Strength + Athletics roll (seep. 261).

	6: Flesh of Marble

	*Tales have long spoken of the combat prowess ofGangrel elders and of their inhuman resilience. Poorlyinformed individuals believe the stories of swords shattering and bullets flattening against immortal skinto be exaggerated reports of the effects of Fortitude.Those with more reliable information know that suchtales result from encounters with vampires who havedeveloped Flesh of Marble. The skin of an elder withFlesh of Marble becomes in essence a sort of flexiblestone, although it appears (and feels) no different thannormal skin and muscle.System: The player spends three blood points to activate Flesh of Marble, which goes into effect instantly.The effects of the power last for the remainder of thescene. While the power is functioning, the damage dicepools of all physical attacks made against the characterare halved (round down). That includes assaults madewith fists, claws, swords, firearms, and explosions, butnot fire, sunlight, or supernatural powers (unless theeffect in questio
n is a direct physical attack, such as arock hurled by means of Movement of the Mind). Additionally, while this power is in effect, a character canattempt to parry melee attacks with his bare hands as ifhe were holding some form of weapon.

	7: Restore the Mortal Visage

	*Cainites are of two opinions regarding this power.Those who are politically active, or who associate extensively with mortals, view it as both necessary andacceptable. Those Kindred who embrace their more feral sides, however, see it as a disgusting defiance of thevery nature of vampirism. The schism comes becausethe power allows the elder who possesses it to temporarily return his appearance to what it was before theEmbrace, removing the bestial features he has accumulated over the centuries. Restore the Mortal Visagehas only been displayed by Gangrel; several Nosferatuelders have attempted to develop it, and it is whisperedthat they met spontaneous, grotesque Final Deathswhen they attempted to take their mortal forms.System: The player spends three blood points anda Willpower point and rolls Willpower (difficulty 8).Success restores the character’s appearance to what itwas just before he was first Embraced, erasing all physical or social animalistic features gained from frenzies
(see p. 55). The power also affects any of the character‘s affected Traits relating to social interaction, returning them to their original values (for example, lostAppearance dots return, but Humanity points removeddue to frenzy are not). A botched Willpower roll earnsthe character another feature, as per the Gangrel Clanweakness. Once activated, Restore the Mortal Visagelasts for the remainder of the scene.

	7: Shape of the Beast’s Wrath

	*Users of this power are often mistaken for Tzimisceemploying the Vicissitude power Horrid Form. A vampire employing this power shifts into a huge, monstrousform, gaining half her height again and tripling herweight. Her overall shape flows into an unholy amalgamation of her own form and that of the animal shefeels the closest kinship to (wolves, rats, and great catsare the most common manifestations, though ravens,serpents, bats, and stranger beasts have been reported).The vampire’s new shape does bear some vague resemblance to the war-forms of the werecreatures, but thedifference quickly becomes apparent.System: The player spends three blood points, theexpenditure of which triggers the change. The character’s transformation takes three turns (the player mayspend additional blood points to reduce this time at acost of one point per turn of reduction). Once transformed, the character remains in this form until sunriseor until she shifts back voluntarily.The precise Traits of this
 form are determined whenthe character first learns this power, as is the animalwhose appearance the character takes on. The vampire’s new form adds a total of seven dots to the character’s Physical Attributes. At least one dot must gointo each Physical Attribute, meaning that no morethan five can go into any one (so a character couldhave +5 Strength, +1 Dexterity, and +1 Stamina, butnot +2 Strength and +5 Dexterity). These bonuses are always the same once they are selected; a different allocation requires that the character buy this power asecond time and thus purchase another alternate form.Additionally, the character inflicts Strength + 2 diceof aggravated damage with both bite and claw attackswhen in monstrous form. She also gains an extra Hurthealth level, and doubles her normal running speed.Finally, the character’s perceptions are also heightened. She is assumed to have both the Auspex powerHeightened Senses and the Protean power Eyes of theBeast after transformation, wit
h all of the benefits anddrawbacks of each.This form does carry two additional drawbacks. Thefirst is a lack of communication ability. The character’sSocial Attributes all drop to 1, or to 0 if they alreadywere 1 (except when making Intimidation rolls) whenthe transformation occurs. The second problem thata character in this form encounters is the suddenlyheightened power of her Beast. All difficulties of rollsto resist frenzy are increased by two for the duration ofthe power’s effect, and the player may not spend Willpower points on such rolls.

	7:Spectral Body

	*This powerful variation on Mist Form allows a vampire to take a shape with most of the advantages of thelesser power but fewer of the disadvantages. A vampirewho assumes Spectral Form retains his normal appearance, but becomes completely insubstantial. He walksthrough walls and bullets with equal ease, and can passthrough the floor on which he stands if he chooses to.Although his lungs are no longer solid, the vampire canstill speak, a fact in which some elders of the Daughtersof Cacophony bloodline have expressed great interest.System: The player spends three blood points. Thetransformation takes one turn to complete, and lastsfor the rest of the night unless the character decides toreverse it. When the power takes hold, the characterbecomes completely insubstantial, but remains fullyvisible. Henceforth, he is unaffected by any physicalattacks, and he doubles his dice pool to soak damagefrom fire and sunlight. The vampire may even ignoregravity if he chooses to do so, rising and si
nking throughsolid objects if he does not wish to stand on them (although he may move no faster than his normal walking speed while “flying” in this manner). While in thisform, the character may also use any Disciplines thatdo not require physical contact or a physical body. Onthe downside, while in Spectral Form, a vampire canphysically manipulate his environment only throughthe use of powers such as Movement of the Mind.

	8:Purify the Impaled Beast

	*Camarilla records indicate that a disproportionatelysmall number of Gangrel elders were killed by mortalsand Anarchs during the Inquisition and the AnarchRevolt. This power is one of the primary reasons forthe survival of these Kindred. An elder with this Protean power can expel foreign objects from her bodywith great force, even excising stakes that transfix herheart.System: The player spends three blood points androlls Willpower (difficulty 6, or 8 if the vampire is paralyzed by an object impaling her heart). One success issufficient to remove all foreign objects and substancesfrom the character’s body. Dirt, bullets, and even stakesthrough the heart are instantly and violently removed.The larger the object, the farther away it is hurled bythis power. Objects expelled thus are considered tohave an attack dice pool of three for any bystanders,and to have a dice pool of one to four (depending onsize) for damage. If the character wishes to leave an object in his body (such as a pro
sthetic limb) or partiallyin (expelling a stake from his heart but leaving it sticking out of his breastbone as a ruse), the player must alsospend a Willpower point when activating this power.

	9:Inward Focus

	*This power has no outwardly visible effects whatsoever. Indeed, its very existence is unknown outsidethose Gangrel Methuselahs who have developed it.The internal effects of this razor-sharp honing of Protean, however, are in some ways more dramatic thanany external manifestation. A vampire with this powercan heighten the efficiency of his undead body’s internal workings to levels undreamed of by lesser Kindred,withstanding inconceivable amounts of injury andmoving with blinding speed and shattering strength.System: The player spends four blood points to activate this power and an additional two blood pointsfor every turn past the first that Inward Focus is maintained. There are three effects of this power: First, thecharacter gains a number of extra actions during eachturn equal to his unmodified Dexterity score. Second,the damage of his physical attacks is increased by threedice per dice pool. Finally, all damage inflicted on thecharacter is halved and rounded down after the soak
roll is made (so an attack that inflicts five health levelsafter soak is reduced to two health levels).This power may be used in conjunction with otherProtean powers that modify the character‘s combatabilities, such as Shape of the Beast’s Wrath (above). It may also be used in conjunction with Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence, turning a vampire who has mastered this power into a truly terrifying opponent.



--Quietus

	*The Discipline of silent death, Quietus is practicedby those of Clan Assamite. Based on elements ofblood, poison, vitae control, and pestilence, Quietusfocuses on the destruction of a target through a varietyof means. This Discipline doesn’t always cause a quickdeath, but the Assamites rely on its lethality to hidetheir involvement with their victims.

	1:Silence of Death

	*Many Assamites claim never to have heard theirtargets’ death screams. Silence of Death imbues thevampire with a mystical silence that radiates from herbody, muting all noise within a certain vicinity. Nosound occurs inside this zone, though sounds originating outside the area of effect may be heard by anyonein it. Rumors abound of certain skilled Assamite vizierswho have the ability to silence a location rather than acircumference that follows them, but no proof of thishas been forthcoming.System: This power (which costs one blood point toactivate) maintains a 20-foot (6-meter) radius of utterstillness around the Kindred for one hour.

	2:Scorpion’s Touch

	*By changing the properties of her blood, a vampiremay create powerful venom that strips her prey of his resilience. This power is greatly feared by other Kindred,and all manner of hideous tales concerning methods ofdelivery circulate among trembling coteries. Kindredwith Quietus are known to deliver the poison by coating their weapons with it, blighting their opponentswith a touch, or spitting it like a cobra. An apocryphalaccount speaks of a proud Prince who discovered anAssamite plotting her exsanguination and began todiablerize her would-be assassin. Halfway through theact, she learned that she had ingested a dire quantity oftainted blood and was then unable to resist the weakened hashashiyyin’s renewed attack.System: To convert a bit of her blood to poison, theKindred’s player spends at least one blood point androlls Willpower (difficulty 6). If this roll is successful,and the vampire successfully hits (but not necessarilydamages) her opponent, the target loses a number ofSt
amina points equal to the number of blood points converted into poison — vampires attempting to drinkthe blood of the Kindred with Scorpion’s Touch areautomatically considered to be “successfully hit.”The victim may resist the poison with a Stamina +Fortitude roll (difficulty 6); successes achieved on theresistance roll subtract from the vampire’s successes.The maximum number of blood points a Kindred mayconvert at any one time is equal to her Stamina. Thenumber of successes scored indicates the duration ofthe Stamina loss.

		@1 success		One turn

		@2 successes		One hour

		@3 successes		One day

		@4 successes		One month

		@5 successes		Permanently (though Stamina maybe bought back up with experience)

	**If a mortal’s Stamina falls to zero through use of Scorpion’s Touch, she becomes terminally ill and loses anyimmunity to diseases, her body succumbing to sicknesswithin the year unless she somehow manages to increase her Stamina again. If a Kindred’s Stamina fallsto zero, the vampire enters torpor and remains that wayuntil one of her Stamina points returns. If a Kindred ispermanently reduced to zero Stamina, she may recoverfrom torpor only through mystical means.To afflict someone with the poison, the Cainite musttouch her target’s flesh or hit him with something thatcarries the venom. Many Assamites lubricate theirweapons with the excretion, while others pool the toxin in their hands (or fleck their lips with the poison,for a “kiss of death”) and press it to their opponents.Weapons so envenomed must be of the melee variety— arrows, sling stones, bullets, thrown weapons, andthe like cannot carry enough of the stuff to do damage,or it drips off in flight. Players whose
 vampires wish tospit at their targets must make a Stamina + Athletics roll (difficulty 6). No more than two blood points’worth of poison may be expectorated, and a Kindredmay spit a distance of 10 feet (3 meters) for each pointof Strength (and Potence) the character possesses.Vampires with Quietus are immune to their own poison, but not the blood-venom of other Kindred withthis power.

	3:Dagon’s Call

	*This terrible power allows a vampire to drown hertarget in his own blood. By concentrating, the Kindredbursts her target’s blood vessels and fills his lungs withvitae that strangles him from within. The blood actually constricts the target’s body from the inside as itfloods through his system; thus, it works even on unbreathing Kindred. Until the target collapses in agonyor death throes, this power has no visible effect, andmany Kindred like it because it leaves no trace of theirpresence.System: The vampire must touch her target priorto using Dagon’s Call. Within an hour thereafter, thevampire may issue the call, though she need not be inthe presence or even in the line of sight of her target.

	**Invoking the power costs one Willpower point.The Kindred’s player makes a contested Stamina rollagainst the target’s Stamina; the difficulty of each rollis equal to the opponent’s permanent Willpower rating. The number of successes the vampire using Dagon’s Call achieves is the amount of lethal damage, inhealth levels, the victim suffers. For an additional pointof Willpower spent in the next turn, the vampire maycontinue using Dagon’s Call by engaging in anothercontested Stamina roll. So long as the Kindred’s playercontinues to spend Willpower, the character may continue rending her opponent from within.

	4:Baal’s Caress

	*The penultimate use of blood as a weapon (short ofdiablerie itself), Baal’s Caress allows the Kindred totransmute her blood into a virulent ichor that destroysany living or undead flesh it touches. In nights of yore,when Assamites led the charges of Saracen legions, theAssassins were often seen licking their blades, slicingopen their tongues and lubricating their weapons withthis foul secretion.Baal’s Caress may be used to augment any bladedweapon; everything from poisoned knives and swordsto tainted fingernails and claws has been reported.System: Baal’s Caress does not increase the damagedone by a given weapon, but that weapon inflicts aggravated damage rather than normal. No roll is necessary to activate this power, but one blood point isconsumed per hit. For example, if a Cainite poisons hisknife and strikes his opponent (even if he inflicts nodamage), one blood point’s worth of lubrication disappears. For this reason, many vampires choose to coat their weapons with a sig
nificant quantity of blood. Ifthe vampire misses, no tainted blood is consumed.

	5:Taste of Death

	*A refinement of Baal’s Caress, Taste of Death allowsthe Cainite to spit caustic blood at her target. Theblood coughed forth with this power burns flesh andcorrodes bone; some vampires have been reported tovomit voluminous streams of vitae that reduce theirtargets to heaps of sludge.System: The vampire may spit up to 10 feet (3 meters) for each dot of Strength and Potence he possesses.Hitting the target requires a Stamina + Athletics roll(difficulty 6). Each blood point spewed at the targetinflicts two dice of aggravated damage, and there is nolimit (other than the vampire’s capacity and per-turnexpenditure maximum) to the quantity of blood withwhich a target may be deluged.

	6: Blood Sweat

	*Although vampires do not have functioning sebaceous glands, they are still capable of sweating attimes of extreme stress. This “sweat” is actually a thinsheen of blood on the Cainite’s forehead and palms.Most Kindred see blood sweat as an admission of fearor guilt. The vampire who has mastered Blood Sweat iscapable of inducing these feelings in a subject to a preternatural degree. The victim experiences a torrentialoutpouring of vitae if he harbors the tiniest shred ofremorse for any action he has ever undertaken.System: The character must be within line of sightof the subject and spend three turns concentrating.The player spends a Willpower point and rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty equal to the target’scurrent Willpower points). The target loses one bloodpoint per success. Mortals sustain injury as if they hadlost blood from being fed upon. The target actually“sweats out” the lost blood in a sudden rush of sanguinary perspiration that soaks his clothes. La
rge amountsmay even form puddles at his feet. Blood lost throughthis process is considered dead, inert mortal blood, andprovides minimal nutrition (half normal) for Cainitesdesperate enough to lick it up from the floor or wringit out of towels. It provides no sustenance for the individual from whom it emerged.In addition to the blood loss, the victim is overcomeby a sense of remorse and guilt for his past transgressions (if he has a strong conscience) or an overwhelming compulsion to brag (if he is of sufficiently coarsemoral character). The severity of this impulse depends on the number of successes rolled: One success couldcause a slight twinge of conscience, while five successesmay result in the subject breaking down and pouringout a full confession of his crimes. This effect is morestory-oriented than mechanical, and the Storyteller isthe final authority on what the victim feels compelledto confess or boast.Note that this power’s existence is not widely known.Vampires and mortal
s alike tend to shrink away fromsomeone who begins spontaneously sweating blood,and experiencing such an affliction may panic even thestaunchest individual.

	6: Selective Silence

	*Although Silence of Death is an effective tool forthe battlefield and the court alike, it is indiscriminatein its effects. The assassin who uses it in preparationfor firing a shotgun also silences the radio over whichher comrades might warn her of an oncoming guard.The courtier who suppresses a room full of dissentingvoices is likewise unable to speak her own mind. Selective Silence allows the skilled Cainite to overcomethese limitations by silencing only those individuals orobjects that she wants to silence.When using this power, most individuals exhale athin mist of blood that clings to the selected subjects,gradually evaporating as Selective Silence’s effectsfade. Some vampires also use a similar technique wheninvoking Silence of Death, in which case the mist surrounds them and moves with them.System: The player spends two blood points androlls Stamina + Stealth (difficulty 7). Each success allows for one individual or object that the character cansilence with this use of the p
ower. Each subject mustbe within 20 yards or meters of the character. Objectslarger than a man count as more than one subject: aheavy machine gun counts as two, a car as three, anda small aircraft as five. Objects larger than a private jetor creatures larger than an elephant cannot be silencedthrough the use of this power.Each subject is completely silenced for a number ofminutes equal to the character’s permanent Willpower.Nothing it does generates sound, though the secondaryeffects of its actions will do so normally. For example, agun silenced with this power will not produce an audible explosion when fired, but its bullets still make noiseas they break the sound barrier. A silenced victim canscream all he likes and not make a sound, but may beable to summon help by smashing a window.

	6: Ripples of the Heart

	*According to Assamite lore, this technique originated with a Byzantine scholar who wanted to protecthis herd from the thirst of other Cainites. Ripples ofthe Heart allows a Cainite to leave emotions withinthe bloodstream of any mortal from whom he feeds.Any other vampire who subsequently drinks from thatmortal experiences those emotions as if they were hisown.System: The character drinks at least one bloodpoint from the subject mortal then spends a minute inphysical contact with the subject while concentratingon the emotion he wishes to leave in her blood. Theplayer spends a point of Willpower and rolls Charisma+ Empathy (difficulty 7 under normal circumstances,5 if the subject is currently experiencing the intendedemotion, 9 if he is currently experiencing a strong opposite emotion). The subject’s blood carries the weightof the intended emotion for one lunar month per success rolled. A mortal’s blood can only carry one emotion at a time. Subsequent attempts to use Ripples ofthe
 Heart on the same individual have no effect untilthe previous application has worn off.Any vampire who drinks from a vessel under the effects of Ripples of the Heart must succeed in a SelfControl/Instinct roll (difficulty of the mortal’s currentWillpower points) as soon as she swallows the firstblood point. If she fails this roll, the vitae-borne emotion immediately overtakes her. The strength of theemotion depends on how many blood points she drinks.One blood point results in a momentary mood swing,two causes a significant shift in demeanor, and threeor more generates a complete change in emotionalstate. Depending on the circumstances and the preciseemotion, the effects of this may be spectacular or catastrophic. A vampire overtaken by romantic passionmay temporarily believe she is in love with the mortal(or any other convenient bystander). One who drinksfrom a hate-infused vessel may rend her prey to shreds,and one who takes a draught of a mortal touched withfear may run away scr
eaming. The vampire remainssubject to the emotion for a number of hours equal tothe mortal’s permanent Willpower, though she is stillsubject to other feelings after the initial rush of sensation.The mortal who is under the effects of Ripples of theHeart is unaware of the power’s effects on him, thoughhe is slightly predisposed toward the emotion in question while the power is in effect. The vampire who used Ripples of the Heart on a mortal is immune to anyeffects from that use.

	6: Purification

	*Although most mortal cultures affix negative connotations to the spilling of blood, most Assamites— indeed, most vampires — have quite the oppositereaction to it. For them, blood is an unlife-affirmingand reinvigorating substance. Purification works onthis principle, using the power of vitae to cleanse andrestore. Rather than purging foreign taints from thebody, Purification allows its wielder to cleanse otherindividuals’ minds and souls of stains, including thoseleft by the mind control of other Kindred. The vampireusing this power expels his own blood through his skinand allows it to soak through his subject, slowly dissipating. As it does so, it carries away spiritual impuritiesand outside influences.System: The character touches the forehead of herintended subject, and both parties spend a minimum offive minutes in deep concentration. The player spendsa number of blood points equal to the subject’s permanent Willpower. The subject rolls Willpower once forevery external s
upernatural influence (a vampiric Discipline, usually) to which his mind has been subjected.The difficulty equals the level of the power in question+4 (or a difficulty of 7 if the power level is unknown,such as one used by a different kind of supernaturalcreature). A success nullifies that effect.Purification has its limits. It can remove directly intrusive influences such as Dominate-implanted commands, Dementation-generated derangements, or theimperatives caused by elder vampires’ Presence. It cannot dispel influences that are transmitted by blood, including a blood bond or the dispositions imparted byone’s Clan or bloodline, nor can it erase those causedby purely mundane techniques such as persuasion,hypnosis, or brainwashing, or genuine emotional statessuch as love and hate. It can remove mind-alteringblood magic effects, but either the character wielding Purification or the power’s beneficiary must havea level of Thaumaturgy equal to or greater than thatwith which the effec
t was placed. A character cannotuse Purification on herself.

	7:Baal’s Bloody Talons

	*The toxin generated by Baal’s Caress is not enough tosignificantly harm some truly fearsome foes. This progressive development of that lesser technique allows itsuser to envenom his weapon with a blood-based poisonso potent that it corrodes the very weapon that bears it, eating away at the strongest metal in a minute orless. However, its effects on its victims are spectacularenough to make the loss of even the most treasuredblades worthwhile. This power’s effects are of very limited duration, as the substance it creates will quicklyevaporate away.System: The character coats an edged weapon withher own blood, as per Baal’s Caress. The player spendsone or more blood points and rolls Willpower (difficulty 7). The weapon now does aggravated damage. It alsogains a number of additional damage dice equal to thenumber of successes rolled plus the number of bloodpoints spent. These extra dice fade at a rate of one perturn as the poison dissipates, drips off, and reacts withthe weapon
s material. Once the extra damage diceare all gone, the weapon’s base damage dice begin tofade at the same rate. The weapon breaks if used whenits base damage is reduced to the wielder’s Strength orless. The only weapons that can resist this corrosionare those created with a supernatural power of a levelequal to or greater than the character’s Quietus rating,though even this is subject to the Storyteller’s discretion.Baal’s Bloody Talons is subject to the same limitations as Baal’s Caress, except the limit on the number of successful strikes that do aggravated damage. Aweapon affected by Baal’s Bloody Talons does aggravated damage with every successful attack until it isdestroyed.At the Storyteller’s discretion, the character may usethe venom this power produces for other purposes, suchas burning through a padlock or destroying an incriminating tape. He may not, however, store this poison forlater use — even if a container proves resistant to it,the substance become
s inert within a few minutes ofleaving its creator’s body.

	7:Poison the Well of Life

	*Beyond leaving emotional traces in a subject’s blood,the master of this Quietus power can now taint thatsame vitae, making it into a deadly poison for any otherCainite who drinks from that mortal. Some vampiresuse Poison the Well of Life to guard their own herdsagainst “poachers” or to ward specific vessels againstindiscriminate feeding. Others have been known toemploy it as a subtle trap for other vampires, turningherds against their owners.System: The character touches the mortal he wishesto taint and smears a streak of his own vitae on thevictim’s skin. The player spends three blood points and rolls Stamina + Occult (difficulty 7). For a number of months equal to the number of successes, anyother vampire who drinks that mortal’s blood sustainstwo health levels of aggravated damage for every bloodpoint imbibed. This damage manifests as a combination of acid burns and something akin to toxic shock.While a mortal is poisonous to vampires, his body’salchemical balance is 
slightly altered toward toxicity.He gains two extra points of Stamina for the purposesof resisting the effects and damage of poisons and acids.However, his bodily excretions, especially his sweat,are slightly more noxious than normal. He suffers aone-die penalty to all Social dice pools if whomeverhe chooses to interact with has a particularly sensitivenose and is close enough to smell him.

	8:Songs of Distant Vitae

	*Blood magic practitioners and individuals skilled atAuspex have long known that vitae can carry residualimpressions of emotion and personality. This powerinvokes those impressions to overwhelm its victimwith “remembered” images and sensations drawn fromthe vessels who held that blood before the vampirefed from them. Particularly strong-willed or hardenedsubjects may shrug off these visions as daydreams, butthose who are less self-possessed can be permanentlychanged by the experience. A side effect of the use ofthis power is the partial destruction of the vitae fromwhich the images are drawn. Some viziers theorize thatthis is the result of motes of the vessels’ consciousnessmaking an effort to escape their usurper.System: The character touches his target and spendsa turn in concentration. The player spends four bloodpoints and rolls Wits + Intimidation in a contestedroll against the victim’s permanent Willpower (difficulty 7). If the target has committed diablerie within anum
ber of nights equal to the character’s Perception,the attacker gains one automatic success. The resultdepends on the number of net successes the attackerrolls. Note that in all invocations of this power, thesensations that the subject relives are expressly negative and terrifying — for example, he experiences noneof the pleasure that would normally accompany theKiss when he flashes back to such an event.In addition to the effects listed below, the subject ofa successful attack loses a number of blood points equalto the number of successes rolled. This vitae oozes fromhis body in warm red trickles that do no damage but arecertain to terrify onlookers.

		@-1 success			The attacker enters a flashbacksequence in which he relives his lastfeeding from the vessel’s point ofview. If the player rolled three ormore “1”s, the character acquires apermanent derangement related tofeeding.

		@0 success		The target is unharmed and immuneto this power for a number of nightsequal to his Willpower.

		@1 success		The target experiences a brief (10second/3-turn) flashback sequence inwhich he relives his last feeding fromthe vessel’s point of view. During thistime, he is at +2 difficulty to all rolls.

		@2 successes		The target experiences a briefmontage (15 seconds/5 turns) offlashbacks during which his viewpointflashes between various feedings fromthe vessels’ points of view. Duringthis time, he is at +3 difficulty to allrolls. Once the initial rush ofsensation passes, he is unsettled andat +1 difficulty to all rolls until hesucceeds on a Self-Control/Instinctroll (difficulty 8), which he mayattempt once per scene.

		@3 successes		The target experiences a compositememory, assembled by his ownsubconscious, of the terror thatvarious vessels felt while beingstalked and fed upon. He mustsucceed in a Courage roll (difficulty8) or instantly enter Rötschreck. Ifhe succeeds in this roll, he is still at+3 difficulty on all actions for therest of the scene due to thedistraction that his visions impose.

		@4 successes		The target is stunned and completelyunable to act for a number ofturns equal to 8 - his Self-Control/Instinct as he is bombarded by asequence of the most terrifyingmemories of his various vessels. Oncethis initial onslaught subsides, hemust roll Courage (difficulty 9) orenter Rötschreck. If he fails this roll,he must roll Self-Control/ Instinct (difficulty 8) or gain theSanguinary Animism derangement.

		@5 successes		The target is thrown into anightmarish reenactment of thegreatest fears of every individualupon whom he has ever fed. He mustmake a successful Self-Control/Instinct roll (difficulty 9) or fall intotorpor for (10 - the target’s Stamina)nights, at the end of which he loseshalf his permanent Willpower andgains the derangement SanguinaryAnimism. If he succeeds on theSelf-Control/Instinct roll, he entersRötschreck for the rest of the night,during which time his greatest fear isof his own image. At the end of thenight, he must succeed at aWillpower roll (difficulty 9) or lose apermanent Willpower point and gainthe derangement SanguinaryAnimism.

	9:Condemn the Sins ofthe Father

	*Although the Second City’s judges recognized tha theritage does not equal guilt, they also encounteredmany situations in which a vampire’s entire brood hadcommitted the same crime. In such cases, the judgesoften decreed the same punishment for all transgressors. This technique, which modern viziers believe tohave originated at that time, allows its wielder to administer such judgments. Through Condemn the Sinsof the Father, a Cainite can apply lesser Quietus powers to an entire lineage.System: After successfully using any lesser Quietuspower on another vampire, the player spends a permanent Willpower point and 10 blood points and rollsStamina + Occult. The difficulty of this roll is equalto four plus the number of Generations of the originaltarget’s descendants that the player wants to affect, upto a maximum difficulty of 10. If the roll succeeds, every descendant of the original target within the specified range of Generations suffers the same effects thatthe original target 
experienced, resisting with his ownrelevant Traits. The player may exempt a number ofpotential subjects from this effect equal to twice thecharacter’s Wits, but the character must know theirfaces or have tasted their vitae.



--Serpentis

	*Serpentis is believed to be the legacy of Set himself, agift to his children. The Followers of Set are very careful to guard this Discipline’s secrets, only teaching theart to those who they deem worthy. Most vampires fearthe Setites because of the powers of Serpentis and itsconnection to snakes and reptiles; this Discipline canevoke a primordial fear in others, particularly thosewho recall the tale of Eden.

	1:The Eyes of the Serpent

	*This power grants the vampire the legendary hypnotic gaze of the serpent. The Kindred’s eyes becomegold with large black irises, and mortals in the character’s vicinity find themselves strangely attracted tohim. A mortal who meets the vampire’s beguiling gazeis immobilized. Until the character takes his eyes offhis victim, the person is frozen in place.System: No roll is required, but this power can beavoided if the mortal takes care not to look into thevampire’s eyes. Vampires and other supernatural creatures can also be affected by this power if the Cainite’splayer succeeds on a Willpower roll (difficulty 9). If attacked or otherwise harmed, supernatural creatures canspend a point of Willpower to break the spell.Note: This is different than normal eye contact detailed on p. 152. The target must be able to see thevampire’s eyes for Eyes of the Serpent to work.

	2:The Tongue of the Asp

	*The vampire may lengthen her tongue at will, splitting it into a fork like that of a serpent. The tonguemay reach 18 inches or half a meter, and makes a terrifyingly effective weapon in close combat.System: The lash of the tongue’s razor fork causes aggravated wounds (difficulty 6, Strength damage). If theKindred wounds her enemy, she may drink blood fromthe target on the next turn as though she had sunk herfangs into the victim’s neck. Horrifying though it is, thetongue’s caress is very like the Kiss, and strikes mortalvictims helpless with fear and ecstasy. Additionally,the tongue is highly sensitive to vibrations, enablingthe vampire to function effectively in the darkness theClan prefers. By flicking his tongue in and out of hismouth, the vampire can halve any penalties relating todarkness (p. 274).

	3:The Skin of the Adder

	*By calling upon her Blood, the vampire may transform her skin into a mottled, scaly hide. A vampire inthis form becomes more supple and flexible.System: The vampire spends one blood point andone Willpower point. Her skin becomes scaly andmottled; this, combined with the character’s increasedflexibility, reduces soak difficulties to 5. The vampiremay use her Stamina to soak aggravated damage fromclaws and fangs, but not from fire, sunlight, or other supernatural energies. The vampire’s mouth widens andfangs lengthen, enabling her bite to inflict an extra dieof damage. Finally, the vampire may slip through anyopening wide enough to fit her head through.The vampire’s Appearance drops to 1, and she is obviously inhuman if observed with any degree of care,though casual passersby might not notice, if the vampire is in darkness or wearing heavy clothing.

	4:The Form of the Cobra

	*The Cainite may change his form into that of a hugeblack cobra. The serpent weighs as much as the vampire’s human form, stretches over 10 feet or three meters long, and is about 20 inches (50 cm) around. The Form of the Cobra grants several advantages, includinga venomous bite, the ability to slither through smallspaces, and a greatly enhanced sense of smell. Thecharacter may use any Disciplines while in this formsave those that require hands (such as Feral Claws).System: The vampire spends one blood point; thechange is automatic, but takes three turns. Clothingand small personal possessions transform with the vampire. The vampire remains in serpent form until thenext dawn, unless he desires to change back sooner.The Storyteller may allow the Setite bonus dice on allPerception rolls related to smell, but the difficulties forall hearing rolls are increased by two. The cobra’s biteinflicts damage equal to the vampire’s, but the vampiredoes not need to grapple his victim; further
more, thepoison delivered is fatal to mortals.

	5:The Heart of Darkness

	*A Kindred with mastery of Serpentis may pull herheart from her body. She can even use this ability onother Cainites, although this requires several hours ofgruesome surgery. This power can only be invoked during a new moon. If performed under any other moon,the rite fails. Upon removing her heart, the vampireplaces it in a small clay urn, and then carefully hides orburies the urn. While her heart is hidden, she cannotbe staked by any wood that pierces her breast. Moreover, because the heart is the seat of emotion, the difficulties of all her rolls to resist frenzy are two lowerwhile this power is in effect.Cainites are careful to keep their hearts safe fromdanger. If someone seizes her heart, the vampire iscompletely at that person’s mercy. The heart can bedestroyed only by casting it into a fire or exposing it tosunlight. If this happens, the Kindred dies where shestands, boiling away into a blistering heap of ash andblackened bone. Plunging a wooden stake into an exposed heart d
rives the vampire into instant torpor.A vampire may carry her heart with her, or haveseveral false hearts buried in different places. A smartKindred often avoids her heart’s hiding place, to deterdiscovery. Those wise in Setite lore whisper that thecorrupt elders of the Clan often hold their underlings’hearts as yet another method of control.System: This power requires no roll. Those who witness a vampire pull his heart from his breast (or cutthe heart from another vampire) must make Couragerolls. Failure indicates anything from strong uneasinessto complete revulsion, possibly even Rötschreck.

	6: Cobra Fangs

	*A character using Form of the Cobra gains a venomous bite along with his serpentine form. Unfortunately,huge black cobras tend to make people run away as fastas they can. This Serpentis power enables a vampireto gain the deadly bite without the full-body transformation, making it more useful for taking victims bysurprise. The police do ask questions when someonedies from a cobra bite under unlikely circumstances, soCobra Fangs still requires some discretion in its use.System: The Kindred expends one blood point, andin one turn his fangs become hollow, more slender andvenomous. The vampire injects venom when he bites.He must still grapple with the victim to deliver a biteattack, and the bite does the usual amount of damage;the venom, however, kills mortals within one minute.Bitten vampires or other supernaturally resilient creatures suffer (10 – victim’s Stamina and Fortitude) levelsof aggravated damage over the course of five minutes.

	7: Divine Image

	*Many of the low-Generation Setite elders no longer need the illusions of Obfuscate to appear as a god.Through this Serpentis power, a vampire can physically metamorphose into the form of a god. Male Kindred generally take the form of Set himself: a muscular manwith the head of the “Typhonic Beast,” an animal witha long, narrow snout and upstanding, square-toppedears. Less often, they take the form of the crocodileheaded god Sobek, whom the Egyptians often linkedto Set, or the wolf-headed war-god Wepwawet, oftenidentified with Set’s son Anubis. Female vampires generally assume the form of the cobra-headed goddessRenenet, wife of Sobek, or the hippopotamus-goddessTaweret, sometimes considered a consort of Set. Bothwere goddesses of pregnancy and childbirth. Setitedoctrine labels all four deities as Set’s eldest childer.While assuming the Divine Image, the vampire becomes stronger, tougher, and more impressive. Moreimportantly, perhaps, the vampire’s will becomes morepowerful
 as he identifies with a divine forebear.System: The character expends three blood pointsand transforms into the Divine Image in one turn. Inthe Divine Image, the vampire gains two dots each ofStrength and Stamina and a dot each of Charisma andManipulation, but her Appearance drops to 1. Theseenhancements can push the vampire over his generational limit. The character also gains two full dots ofWillpower (to a maximum of 10). The Cainite can stayin the Divine Image for a full scene.A vampire has only one Divine Image form (unlessthe player buys this power twice). The character doesnot know what Divine Image he will manifest until heinvokes the power the first time, although the playercan freely choose the preferred form.

	8: Heart Thief

	*The Serpentis power Heart of Darkness normallytakes hours to perform upon other vampires, and onlyworks at the dark of the moon. Some elders, however,can pull the heart from another vampire’s chest witha quick snatch. This does not destroy the victim, unless the attacker then destroys the stolen heart. HeartThief is not an easy power to use despite its speed, butfew Discipline effects can place one vampire in another’s power so suddenly and completely.System: The character must expend one Willpowerpoint. Removing the heart of a reluctant vampire is adifficult feat, comparable to staking: the attacker mustgarner at least three successes on a Dexterity + Brawlattack (difficulty 9). The victim may use Fortitude to“soak” the attacker’s successes, but mundane Staminahas no effect against this magical attack.A vampire who loses his heart this way takes oneunsoakable level of aggravated damage, and receives all the benefits and drawbacks of the Heart of Darknesspower. Resisting f
renzy becomes easier (-2 difficulty)and he cannot be staked by wood that impales hisbreast. On the other hand, thrusting a stake throughthe removed heart will instantly force the vampire intotorpor and exposing the heart to fire or sunlight willbum the vampire to ash; even biting into the heart willcause aggravated wounds to the vampire in question.

	9: Shadow of Apep

	*Only Set and Set’s own childer can perform this terrifying power. These ancient monsters can take the formof Set’s defeated enemy, Apep. The vampire becomesa giant serpent of fluid, glittering Darkness — not mereshadow, but anti-light, like the black force commandedby Obtenebration. In this form, physical force cannotharm the vampire: not claws or fangs, not bullets, notexplosions, nothing but fire, sunlight, or mystical powers. Physical barriers cannot easily stop the vampire,whose shadowy form can seep through even the tiniestcrack. The vampire, however, can still exert physicaland supernatural force quite freely.System: Taking the form of Apep costs a Willpowerpoint. The transformation takes three turns to complete; once the vampire has transformed, her body remains changed for one scene. In this form, the vampiretakes no damage from any physical attack: fists, weapons, or falling buildings pass through the vampire as ifshe were a shadow. Fire and sunlight inflict the norma
l aggravated damage, however, and mystical powers (such as Thaumaturgy) still affect the transformedvampire. The vampire’s new body gains three dots ineach Physical Attribute. Ignore generational limits forthis purpose. The transformed vampire can use herStrength to make normal close combat attacks andcan bite for Strength + 2 dice of damage. The vampirecan also employ any Discipline that does not requirehands.



--Vicissitude

	*Vicissitude is the signature power of the Tzimisce,and is rarely shared outside the Clan (though it isknown to some other Cainites of the Sabbat). Similarto Protean in some ways, Vicissitude allows vampiresto shape and sculpt flesh and bone. When a Kindreduses Vicissitude to alter mortals, ghouls, and vampiresof higher Generation, the effects of the power are permanent; vampires of equal or lower Generation canchoose to heal the effects of Vicissitude as though theywere aggravated wounds. A wielder of Vicissitude canalways reshape her own flesh.The wielder must establish skin-to-skin contact andmust often manually sculpt the desired result for thesepowers to take effect. This also applies to the use of thepower on oneself. Tzimisce skilled in Vicissitude areoften inhumanly beautiful; those less skilled are simplyinhuman.There are rumors that Vicissitude is a disease ratherthan a “normal” Discipline, but only the Fiends knowfor sure, and they aren’t talking.Note: Nosferatu alwa
ys “heal” Vicissitude alterations, at least the ones that make them better-looking.The ancient curse of the Clan may not be circumvented through Vicissitude. The same applies to physicaldeformities from the Gangrel Clan weakness.

	1:Malleable Visage

	*A vampire with this power may alter her own bodilyparameters: height, build, voice, facial features, andskin tone, among other things. Such changes are cosmetic and minor in scope — no more than a foot (30cm) of height gained or lost, for example. She mustphysically mold the alteration, literally shaping herflesh into the desired result.System: The player must spend a blood point foreach body part to be changed, then roll Intelligence +Medicine (difficulty 6). To duplicate another person orvoice requires a Perception + Medicine roll (difficulty8), and five successes are required for a flawless copy;fewer successes leave minute (or not-so-minute) flaws.Increasing one’s Appearance Trait has a difficulty of 9,and the vampire must spend an additional blood pointfor each dot of Appearance increased beyond their natural total. A botch permanently reduces the Attributeby one.

	2:Fleshcraft

	*This power is similar to Malleable Visage, above, butallows the vampire to perform drastic, grotesque alterations on other creatures. Tzimisc often use this powerto transform their servitors into monstrous guards, thebetter to frighten foes. Only flesh (skin, muscle, fat,and cartilage, but not bone) may be transformed.System: After spending a blood point, the vampire must grapple the intended victim. The player ofthe Flescrafting vampire makes a successful Dexterity + Medicine roll (difficulty variable: 5 for a crudeyank-and-tuck, up to 9 for precise transformations). Avampire who wishes to increase another’s AppearanceTrait does so as described under Malleable Visage; reducing the Attribute is considerably easier (difficulty5), though truly inspired disfigurement may dictate ahigher difficulty. In either case, each success increasesor reduces the Attribute by one.A vampire may use this power to move clumps ofskin, fat, and muscle tissue, thus providing additionalpadding where nee
ded. For each success scored on aDexterity + Medicine roll (difficulty 8), the vampiremay increase the subject’s soak dice pool by one, at theexpense of either a point of Strength or a health level(vampire’s choice).

	3:Bonecraft

	*This terrible power allows a vampire to manipulatebone in the same manner that flesh is shaped. In conjunction with Fleshcraft, above, this power enables aVicissitude practitioner to deform a victim (or herself)beyond recognition. This power should be used in conjunction with the flesh-shaping arts, unless the vampire wants to inflict injury on the victim (see below). System: The vampire’s player must spend a bloodpoint and make a Strength + Medicine roll (difficultiesas above). Bonecraft may be used without the fleshshaping arts, as an offensive weapon. Each successscored on the Strength + Medicine roll (difficulty 7)inflicts one health level of lethal damage on the victim, as his bones rip, puncture, and slice their way outof his skin.The vampire may utilize this power (on herself orothers) to form spikes or talons of bone, either on theknuckles as an offensive weapon or all over the bodyas defensive “quills.” If bone spikes are used, the vampire or victim takes one health l
evel of lethal damage(the vampire’s comes from having the very sharp bonepierce through his skin — this weaponry doesn’t comecheaply). In the case of quills, the subject takes a number of health levels equal to five minus the number ofsuccesses (a botch kills the subject or sends the vampireinto torpor). These health levels may be healed normally. Knuckle spikes inflict Strength +1 lethal damage. Defensive quills inflict a hand-to-hand attacker’sStrength in lethal damage unless the attacker scoresthree or more successes on the attack roll (in whichcase the attacker takes no damage); the defender stilltakes damage normally. Quills also enable the vampireor altered subject to add two to all damage inflicted viaholds, clinches, or tackles.A vampire who scores five or more successes on theStrength + Medicine roll may cause a rival vampire’srib cage to curve inward and pierce the heart. Whilethis does not send a vampire into torpor, it does causethe affected vampire to lose half 
his blood points, asthe seat of his vitae ruptures in a shower of gore.

	4:Horrid Form

	*Kindred use this power to become hideous and deadly monsters. The vampire’s stature increases to a fulleight feet (two and a half meters), the skin becomes asickly greenish-gray or grayish-black chitin, the armsbecome apelike and ropy with ragged black nails, andthe face warps into something out of a nightmare. Arow of spines sprouts from the vertebrae, and the external carapace exudes a foul-smelling grease.System: The Horrid Form costs two blood points toawaken. All Physical Attributes increase by three, butall Social Attributes drop to zero, except when dealingwith others also in Horrid Form. However, a vampirein Horrid Form who is trying to intimidate someonemay substitute Strength for a Social Attribute. Damage inflicted in brawling combat increases by one due to the jagged ridges and bony knobs creasing the creature’s hands.

	5:Bloodform

	*A vampire with this power can physically transformall or part of her body into sentient vitae. This bloodis in all respects identical to the vampire’s normal vitae; she can use it to nourish herself or others, createghouls, or establish blood bonds. If all this blood is imbibed or otherwise destroyed, the vampire meets FinalDeath.System: The vampire may transform all or part ofherself as she deems fit. Each leg can turn into twoblood points worth of vitae, as can the torso; each arm,the head, and the abdomen convert to one blood pointeach. The blood can be reconverted to the body part,provided it is in contact with the vampire. If the bloodhas been utilized or destroyed, the vampire must spenda number of blood points equal to what was originallycreated to regrow the missing body part.A vampire entirely in this form may not be staked,cut, bludgeoned, or pierced, but can be burned or exposed to the sun. The vampire may ooze along, drip upwalls, and flow through the narrowest cracks,
 as thoughshe were in Tenebrous Form (p. 190).Mental Disciplines may be used, provided no eyecontact or vocal utterance is necessary, although thevampire can perceive her surroundings just fine (butthe perceptions are always centered on the largest poolof blood). If a vampire in this form “washes” over amortal or animal, that mortal must make a Courageroll (difficulty 8) or fly into a panic.

	6: Chiropteran Marauder

	*Similar to Horrid Form, the Chiropteran Marauderis a terrifying, bipedal bat, bearing a wickedly fangedmaw and veined, leathery wings. This power confers allof the benefits of the Horrid Form, in addition to a fewothers. The mere sight of the marauder is enough tomake mortals or weak-willed vampires flee in horror.System: The vampire gains all the effects of the Horrid Form. Further, the Marauder’s fluted wings allowflight at 25 mph (40 kph), during which the vampiremay carry, but not manipulate, objects no larger thanit can hold in its hands. If the player chooses to, shemay make a Strength + Medicine roll (difficulty 6) toextend bony claws at the ends of the vampire’s wings.These claws inflict Strength +2 aggravated damage.Also, the vampire subtracts two from all hearing-basedPerception rolls (though he adds one to vision- based Wits and Perception rolls). Assuming the mantle ofthe Chiropteran Marauder costs three blood points.

	6: Blood of Acid

	*At this level of mastery, the vampire has convertedhis blood to a viscous acid. Any blood he consumeslikewise becomes acid, which is corrosive enough toburn human (and vampiric flesh) as well as wood. Thiseffect is particularly potent when the vampire assumesthe Bloodform. One of the side effects of this poweris the complete inability to create new vampires andghouls, or give blood to another vampire — the acidwould corrode them as they drank it. The obvious benefit, however, is that would-be diablerists are likewiseunable to devour the Cainite’s blood.System: Each acidified blood point that comes incontact with something other than the vampire himself does five dice worth of aggravated damage. If thevampire is injured in combat, his blood may spatter onan opponent — foes must make Dexterity + Athleticsrolls to avoid the blood, which must be accomplished bysplitting their dice pools. (Unless an opponent knowsthe vampire has this power, she’s unlikely to split herdice pool on
 her first attack, which causes many Tzimisce to cackle with glee.)

	7: Cocoon

	*The Cainite can form an opaque cocoon from bloodand other fluids excreted from her body. The cocoonhardens after a few moments, turning into a tough,white shell. This cocoon provides considerable protection to the vampire, even shielding her from sunlightand, to a limited degree, fire.System: A vampire may only cocoon herself, and theprocess takes 10 minutes. Additionally, creating a cocoon costs three blood points. The cocoon offers complete protection from sunlight, and provides a numberof dice of soak equal to twice the vampire’s unmodifiedStamina against all damage, aggravated or otherwise. It lasts as long as the Cainite wishes, and she may dissolve it at her whim, emerging from a pulpy, bloodypaste. A vampire contained within a cocoon may stilluse mental Disciplines that do not require eye contactor other conditions to be met.

	8: Breath of the Dragon

	*The vampire becomes like one of the terrible draculsof the Old World, able to exhale a deadly gout of flame.This flame does not hurt the vampire himself, thoughhe may become trapped in flames if it engulfs flammable objects.System: The flaming cloud affects a six-foot area, doing two dice of aggravated damage to anyone in theflames’ circumference. This fire may cause combustibleitems to ignite, and it may ignite victims who suffer firedamage as per the fire rules on page 297.

	9:Earth’s Vast Haven

	*This power, developed in the nights when the Tzimisce were the terrible masters of Eastern Europe,allows the vampire to sink into and disperse himselfthrough the ground. Unlike the Protean power of EarthMeld, however, the vampire actually dissolves his bodyinto the ground; nothing short of a wide-area explosion can affect him, and he may not be dug up bodily.In addition, from sunset to sunrise, the vampire maysee and hear everything happening in his environmentthrough his mystical connection to the land. The merefact that this power exists terrifies many Tzimisce, whoare secretly unsure of whether or not the diablerie oftheir Antediluvian was successful.System: This power costs six blood points to activate, and it lasts as long as the vampire wishes to remain contained within the soil. As per the Cocoon,the vampire may use mental Disciplines that do notrequire physical solvency or eye contact. He may communicate mentally with anyone who wanders into thearea under which he rests.



--Bardo

	*This Discipline has been handed down since Osirishimself first discovered this path. It involves attainment of a constant state of mystical consciousness, onlyachieved by the rigid, ascetic unlife of the Children.This Discipline is not the same state as Golconda. Golconda is a realization and acceptance of the way thingsare, while the Children’s Disciplines are based on denial. They deny the Beast within them by intensely concentrating on their Humanity and their state of death.If a Child was to give up his meditations and discipline,he would be assailed by his Beast. The Child must maintain Humanity equal to theirhighest level of ability, or else lose that ability. Forexample, a Child must have a Humanity of 9 to gainthe ninth level of attainment. If the Child’s Humanityever drops below the required level, then the ability ofthat level is lost and must be bought all over again withexperience points. The Child can counteract this withRestore Humanitas (below).A Child of Osiris c
annot follow any type of moralcode other than Humanity.

	1:Restore Humanitas

	*The first thing that the Children of Osiris are taughtis that Humanity does not have to be an inexorableslide into depravity. Instead, it is more akin to a climbup an extremely steep hill. The vampire is going to losesome ground, but with perseverance and strength, hecan regain it. System: When the vampire loses a dot of Humanity,he can attempt to regain it without spending experience points by using this power. The Child must usethis power within a week of losing the Humanity, andmust not have lost any more Humanity since the initialloss (that is, if the character falls from Humanity 8 toHumanity 7, and then falls to Humanity 6 before usingthis power, Restore Humanitas can only be used to recover Humanity 7). The character meditates for several hours, and spends all of the blood points currently inhis body. The player then rolls Conscience (difficultyequal to the level of Humanity being regained). If theroll succeeds, the character regains the dot of Humanity and (if applicable) th
e dot of Conscience lost toa botched degeneration roll. If the character gained aderangement, it fades within a week of using RestoreHumanitas.

	2:Banishing Sign of Thoth

	*The character gestures, turning aside any supernatural effect aimed at her. The source of the effect does notmatter. She can thwart, or at least blunt, the strengthof any mystical attack. This sign was supposedly taughtto Osiris by Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom andmagic. What Thoth actually was — vampire, mortal,or spellcaster — is lost to time.System: The player spends a blood point and rollsDexterity + Occult (difficulty 7). This power can beused to “dodge” any incoming attack of a mystical nature, including any Disciplines that target the character (whether or not they actually inflict damage). Any successes the player rolls are subtracted from the successes on the attacker’s roll. The sign does not serveto turn aside magically enhanced physical attacks; apunch from a vampire with the Potence Discipline stillhas the full effect.

	3:Gift of Apis

	*All vampires must consume blood, no matter howgood their intentions. While this basic fact of undeathcannot be circumvented, the Children of Osiris can atleast avoid drinking human blood.System: Animal blood is just as nourishing to thecharacter as human blood. An animal is considered tohave a blood pool equal to the number of health levels it has, rather than the lesser value usually assignedto represent the creature’s less-than-filling fluids (seep. 270 for more on drinking from animals). This abilityis always active.

	4:Pillar of Osiris

	*In the center of every temple is a Pillar of Osiris, aplace of meditation and power in which the Children’smagic is greatly increased. At this level of Bardo, thecharacter learns to create such a Pillar, meaning thathe can create his own temple.System: Creating the Pillar of Osiris requires anight-long ritual, with the difficulty determined by thelocation. The more remote and free from violence thelocation is, the lower the difficulty. A cave far fromhuman populations that has never seen violence mightbe difficulty 5, which the site of a grisly murder-suicidein a downtown area would be difficulty 9. The playerspends a Willpower point and rolls Willpower. Successcreates the Pillar, which does not require a physical pillar — the Pillar of Osiris is conceptual, not literal Once the Pillar is created, any vampire with at leastone dot of Bardo receives a -3 to the difficulties of anyDiscipline or other mystical activity (including bloodmagic) performed at the Pillar. However, this re
quiresregular trips to the Pillar. Once the vampire has created a Pillar, he must visit it at least once a month, orit ceases to function. In addition, for every week heis away from a Pillar (not necessarily the one he created), the difficulties of all rolls to avoid frenzy increaseby one. The Beast, long denied by the Child’s asceticpractices, grows in strength while away from the Pillar, and eventually pushes the vampire to frenzy and(likely) Humanity loss. The Children of Osiris, for thisand other reasons, do not leave their temples for long.

	5:Paradox

	*The Child utters a phrase or a riddle that lays barethe truth of the universe to a listener. That truth — theperspective of that one listener’s importance weighedagainst the whole of creation — is enough to immobilize the target for short while. Although this experience would seem to be disheartening, after the factthe targets are loath to harm the Child. Whether that’sbecause of a newfound appreciation for one’s place inthe world, or out of fear that the vampire will revealthe paradox again, no one really knows.System: The vampire speaks the phrase, and theplayer spends a point of Willpower and rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty equal to the listener’s currentWillpower). If multiple listeners are present, the playerrolls against the highest difficulty. If the roll is successful, the listener(s) is immobilized for the scene as hecontemplates what he has heard. Striking the victimsnaps him out of it. At the end of the scene, the paradox is gone, and the target can’
t ever quite explain it.He does, however, suffer a permanent +1 difficulty toharm or act against the Child of Osiris.

	6: Boon of Anubis

	*The vampire can protect a mortal from Embrace,leaving instructions for Anubis, the judge of the dead,not to take this particular mortal to his scales. If themortal is Embraced while under the power of this Discipline, she simply sleeps for a full night and day, andawakens aching and sick, but unharmed.In order to enact this power, the Child of Osiris mustkiss the mortal, usually on the forehead.System: The vampire spends a point of Willpowerand rolls Humanity. If the roll succeeds, the target isimmune to the Embrace for a number of months equalto the successes rolled. The player can spend a dot ofWillpower to make the effect permanent. Note thatthis Discipline does not protect against any other formof death than the Embrace. If a vampire drains the unfortunate victim dry and then shoots her in the head,she dies just the same. However, the difficulty to avoiddegeneration when killing or harming someone underprotection of this power is increased by three.

	7: Bring Forth the Dawn

	*This power does not actually cause the sun to rise, butrather triggers the daysleep in Kindred. The Child simply gestures, and the target’s Beast responds as thoughthe sun had just risen outside. The Child can then beat a hasty retreat — or stake and behead the vampire nowlying helpless before him.System: The player spends a blood point for eachvampire to be affected and rolls Manipulation + Occult in a contested roll against each target’s Humanityor Path (both rolls at difficulty 7). If the target wins,the power fails. If the Child wins, however, all affectedvampires fall asleep for a number of hours equal to theChild’s net successes. Followers of Set and other bloodlines that share their weakness suffer a -2 to their dicepool for this roll. Any Disciplines or Thaumaturgy rituals which protect the Kindred during their sleep alsowork in defending against this level of Bardo.

	8: Mummification

	*The Children of Osiris have an uneasy relationshipwith destroying other vampires. They would prefer notto do so, but some Kindred are too evil to be allowedto exist. For the vampires that straddle the line — thatare wicked, but retain a spark of Humanity — the Children sometimes use Mummification.This long ritual allows a vampire to be put into torpor for as long as the Child wishes. The target can attempt to struggle free, but only once per century. Oncethe vampire is mummified, the Children usually sealher up in a deep tomb, where (hopefully) she will remain undisturbed.System: The target must be immobilized, rituallybound in strips of fabric, and prepared with incenseand special herbs. The player then rolls Willpower in acontested action against the target’s Willpower (bothdifficulty 8). If the Child wins, the target enters torpor. If the victim wins, he remains awake and the ritualcannot be completed for another night (meaning thatresistance is usually temporary). The targ
et can also attempt to shake the spell free once per century, with aWillpower roll (difficulty 9).Ghouls can also be mummified, but they get nochance to escape.

	9: Ra’s Blessing

	*This ritual is difficult, but allows the vampire to accomplish the impossible — walking in sunlight, fullyexperiencing the day once more. Gaining Ra’s Blessingrequires a month-long period of fasting and meditation,at the end of which the character might be granted thechance to spend a few precious hours in sunlight. Eventhis brief period, however, can bolster the character’sHumanity. System: After completing the month of contemplation, the character ritually washes herself and preparesto greet the dawn. The player spends 10 blood pointsand rolls Humanity (difficulty 9). Every success allowsthe character to withstand the sunlight as if she weremortal for a single hour. If the roll fails or botches, thecharacter cannot attempt Ra’s Blessing for a decade.If the roll succeeds, though, the character can usethe reaffirmation of seeing sunlight as a way to boosther Humanity and Virtues. For every hour spent under the sun, the Child can roll his Humanity, or oneof his Virtues, again
st a difficulty of 9. Success meansthat trait is raised by one, while failure or botching thisroom means no gain.



--Daimoinon

	*These are the mysteries of the Baali, black arts tornwhole and beating from the sorcerer-kings of ancientcultures and prehistoric civilizations, incoherentmemories passed from tome to tongue, hearkening totimes of oblivion. They are sibilant secrets in which allbegins to end and begin again. With every new nightand novice brought into the circle, the telling growsshorter.

	1:Sense the Sin

	*A real mark always convinces himself. The mostdangerous Baali aren’t the ones that use extortion,threats, or over displays of power; the most dangerousDemons simply know how to talk their victims intocutting their own throats. This power allows the Baalito find a target’s particular vice.System: The player rolls Perception + Empathyagainst living or undead beings; the difficulty is equalto the subject’s Self-Control or Instincts +4. If successful, the Baali can sense the subject’s greatest weakness.The significance of this information is dictated by thedegree of success: One success might determine a lowVirtue, weak Willpower, or a poorly defended avenueof approach, while two might yield a closely guardedsecret or conversational misstep. Three or more yieldsa central derangement or formative trauma from thesubject’s past.

	2:Fear of the Void Below

	*Once the Baali has mastered reading a subject’s darkest secrets, he can reach into the victim’s mind andtwist what he finds there. The shock of feeling one’s most deeply held beliefs and darkest fears manipulatedcan send the victim into catatonia or fits of panic.System: The Baali must first employ Sense the Sin(above) or use some other method to discern the tragicflaw of the target. She must then speak to the target,playing upon his inadequacies and the inescapableconsequences of his shortcomings. A successful Wits+ Intimidation roll (difficulty of the subject’s Courage+4) drives the victim into fits of terror (one success),mindless panic-borne flight similar to Rötschreck (twosuccesses), or even unconsciousness (three or moresuccesses). All effects last for the remainder of thescene. Kindred targets may resist with a Courage roll(difficulty equal to the Baali’s Willpower) — they areaccustomed to dealing with their Beasts. If the Kindredtarget garners more successes th
an the Baali did on heroriginal roll, he resists the power completely.

	3:Conflagration

	*Not all of the Baali’s powers are designed for manipulation and subtlety. The Demons can also call up thefire from the realms of their infernal patrons, hurling itat their enemies in exultation of the Outer Dark. Thisfire spreads and burns normally, but at the moment ofcreation it is black and cold, as though drawn from aplace where terrestrial physics do not apply.System: The player spends a blood point. This createsa bolt of black flame that inflicts one die of aggravateddamage; more blood points may be spent to increasethe size and damage of the flame. Such fires are fleetingand dissipate at the end of the turn, unless the Baalicontinues to spend blood points on Conflagration overseveral turns, gradually creating a larger flame. Theplayer also rolls Dexterity + Occult (difficulty 6) to hithis target, who may dodge as normal. Vampires confronted with this black fire make Rötschreck tests as ifconfronted with a similar quantity of normal flame.

	4:Psychomachia

	*With this power, the Baali combines his ability toread the psyche of a victim with the ability to summonup matter from the Outer Dark. Psychomachia pits avictim against the most dangerous, shameful parts ofher own subconscious.System: The vampire, after learning the targets tragic flaw (such as after using Sense the Sin, above), forcesthe subject’s player to roll her lowest Virtue (difficulty6). Failing this roll pits the target against an apparitionsummoned from her darker self, perceptible to the subject only. The target may see or feel his abusive father, a long-dead lover, a childhood bogeyman, or (for Kindred victims) even the Beast itself. A botch indicatesthe target has been overwhelmed and frenzies — or,worse, becomes possessed by his inner demons.This imaginary antagonist may be wholly narrated,or assigned Traits equivalent or slightly inferior to thevictim’s, at the Storyteller’s option. All injuries sustained by the target in such an encounter are illusory(substit
ute catatonia or torpor for death as appropriate)and vanish upon the phantasm’s defeat or the Baali’sloss of concentration.

	5:Condemnation

	*The Baali levies a curse upon the victim. The moreskillful in her dark studies the Baali has become, themore dire the curse is likely to be. Legend states thatsome Baali can wield curses so foul that the victims attempt suicide after a single night — only to find thatthey can no longer die.System: An Intelligence + Occult roll (difficultyequal to the subject’s Willpower) dictates the lengthand severity of the curse. Successes must be split between both these effects, as per the sidebar below.The player must split successes between effect andduration – curses with zero successes allotted to duration last for one night. For example, if the Baali’s playerrolls four successes, she can inflict a two-success cursefor one month, a three-success curse for up to week,or a four-success curse for one night. At any time, theBaali may choose to end the curse. Storytellers shouldfeel free to invent creative or story-appropriate curses.

	6: Concordance

	*The Baali makes a Devil’s bargain and takes theunholy nature of his masters into his own being. Thiswarps his body both to his detriment and benefit. Atruly dedicated Demon might make numerous suchpacts, growing more grotesque and more powerful eachtime.System: The most typical manifestation of thispower incorporates immunity to the damaging effectsof fire, though other equivalently-powered assets maybe available at the Storyteller’s option. Most of thesetributes take the form of left-handed “gifts” with unforeseen consequences (a telltale bronze tint to flameresistant flesh, a vestigial set of wings, visible talons orhorns that cannot be concealed, etc.). This Disciplinemay be purchased more than once at greater cost tobody and soul. (The current shaitan is said to have beenso gnarled and twisted by the Masters as to be no longer even remotely mistakable for human.)Note that three of the banes particular to the Baali— piety, vulnerability to sunlight, and dependency onblo
od for sustenance — may not be overcome by thisDiscipline under any circumstances. In the end, it isup to the Storyteller’s discretion what the Baali can orcannot withstand.

	7: Summon the Herald of Topheth

	*Using the same skill that allows for calling up demon-fire, the Baali can call a minion of his masters toEarth. Although the names assigned them differ (angel, demon, daeva, djinn, efreet, malakim, shedim, and countless others), the end results are the same. Thisbeing is under the Baali’s control, at least for a shorttime after being summoned. Yet scholars who havestudied the blasphemous rite by which this Disciplineis enacted note that no provision is made for banishingthe Herald.System: To summon a Herald of Topheth, the Demon must spend at least three blood points and perform an infernal ceremony. Heralds of Topheth havethe following stats: Attributes 10/7/3, Abilities (15points worth), Willpower 8, Disciplines (10 pointsworth), Fortitude of at least 3, and the capacity to healone health level at least every other round. Storytellers should feel free to alter these guidelines based onthe power level of the troupe and the form the Heraldtakes. Though most celestial beings chafe 
at the notionof wearing a single shape, many adopt those commonto myth and legend; preternatural succubi or angels,reptilian horrors, and bat-winged monsters are amongthe most often seen.

	8: Contagion

	*The most damaging disease is human sin. Pandoralearned it to her detriment, as did the ungrateful andimpolite denizens of Sodom. The Baali, of course, revelin the slow decay of human settlements, and Methuselahs of the bloodline learn to infect a mortal community with jealousy, slander, hate, and bigotry. Crimeand violence soar, petty angers give rise to seethinghatreds, and local economies take a downward spiral.Marriages end over trivial quarrels and the world becomes a nastier place in general. In the history of theBaali, entire towns and villages have been temporarilyenslaved to an infernal master’s will.System: Successes garnered on an Intelligence + Occult roll (difficulty 9) must be divided between the intensity and the area of the desired effect – at least twosuccesses are needed to cover both area and effect. Sufficiently high degrees of Auspex or powers that detectdemons may be able to pick up on this vague, malevolent aura; otherwise they will simply assume that times
have taken a dire change for the worse.

		@1 success		Immediate vicinity			Ill-tempered/out-ofsorts behavior		

		@2 successes		An office complex			Civil/domesticunrest, prejudice

		@3 successes 		A city block				Angry (even riotous)dissent

		@4 successes		A stadium or apartment complex	Bar-brawls,hatecrimes, blood in thestreets

		@5+ successes 		An entire city 			A throng of blood thirsty single-minded Philistines

	9: Call the Great Beast

	*This Discipline is largely theoretical. Baali have, inthe past, boasted that their most powerful elders knowa ritual that can tear a rift to the Outer Dark and allowthe creatures that dwell there into our world. Occasionally, a vampire destroys a Baali and sees the beginnings of such a ritual carved on a wall or tattooed ontoa minion’s flesh. But even among the Kindred whoknow of the Baali and what they are capable of, theability to Call the Great Beast doesn’t meet with muchcredence. This isn’t because the Kindred don’t thinkit’s possible, but because they realize that if a Demonever succeeded in using it, there wouldn’t be much tobe done anyway.System: The preparatory ritual requires a tremendous investment of time and sacrifice; veiled allusionssuch as “fivescore souls, plucked clean and whole” and“when three times sets the hooded sun” indicate a selective sacrificial rite spanning days, nights, and dozensof victims. (Deviation or imperfection in this litanyma
y well have unforeseen consequences, ranging fromsimple failure to unwelcome demonic attention)At this point, the high priest expends all of his permanent Willpower and releases his consciousness in adesperate attempt to breach the gulf Beyond, becoming an empty vessel for whatever will most effectivelyend the world as your chronicle knows it. You’re theStoryteller — what would the Devil do to your world?(Call the Great Beast has two main functions in thechronicle. It’s either a plot device that the charactersmust work to prevent, or a means to change the worldof Vampire into a demon-infested apocalypse. Either isuseful, but it’s not the sort of power that a vampire justpulls out casually.)



--Flight

	*Gargoyles possess a fourth in-clan Discipline, calledFlight. All Gargoyles start with a free dot, and it canbe increased like any other Discipline. As the Gargoylegains dots of Flight, he becomes capable of flying faster,as follows:

	1:The character cannot actually fly, but can soar likea hang-glider. He also cannot carry anything (he needshis hands to help steer). Maximum speed is equal toprevailing winds, or 15 miles/25 kilometers per hourin calm air.

	2:The character can make a running takeoff andcarry 20 pounds/10 kilograms while flying. Maximumspeed is 30 miles/50 kilometers per hour.

	3:The character can make a straight, verticaltakeoff if unencumbered, or can make a running takeoff carrying up to 50 pounds/25 kg. Maximum air speedis 45 miles/70 kilometers per hour.

	4:The character can now make a vertical takeoffwith up to 50 pounds/25 kg of baggage, but can carry upto 100 pounds/45 kg while flying. Maximum speed is 60miles/95 kilometers per hour.

	5:The character can now carry up to 200pounds/90 kg, easily enough to carry away an adultperson (or vampire). Maximum speed is 75 miles/120kilometers per hour.Further dots in the Discipline add 100 pounds/45 kgof weight and 20 miles/30 kilometers per hour to thespeed. Gargoyles don’t think of Flight as a Discipline.To them, it’s just flight, part and parcel to being a Gargoyle, and may be baffled by notions such as teachingit to other vampires.



--Melpominee

	*Named for Melpomene, the Greek Muse of tragedy,the unique Discipline of the Daughters of Cacophonyis one of speech and song. The powers of this Discipline explore the various uses of the voice for bothbenefit and harm. As is the case with mortal art, it isnot always clear which of those directions these powerstake. No character may have a rating in Melpomineehigher than her Performance rating. Melpominee affects the subject’s soul as well as the ears; thus, it worksperfectly well on deaf subjects, and has caused at leastone known breach of the Masquerade due to this effect.Additionally, the powers of Melpominee work only onthose who are present when it is used — Daughtersof Cacophony cannot record Melpominee effects, sendthem across radio waves, or have them streamed overthe Internet.Daughters of Cacophony can use some of the powers ofthe Melpominee Discipline in concert, as it were. If morethan one Siren uses the same level of this Discipline simultaneously, the difficulty for 
the roll falls by one foreach Daughter involved beyond the first. The difficultycannot fall lower than 3, however. The Discipline levelsthat can benefit from this rule are noted below.

	1:The Missing Voice

	*The character can “throw” her voice anywhere within her line of sight. This enables the Daughter to carryon surreptitious conversations, sing duets with herself,or cause any number of distractions. This power canalso be combined with other Melpominee powers todisguise their source (and some Daughters use it toconceal the fact that Melpominee powers do not function through recorded media). System: This power functions automatically as longas the character wills it. However, using The MissingVoice while performing any action other than speechor singing incurs a penalty of two dice on that actiondue to the disruption of the character’s concentration.

	2:Phantom Speaker

	*The Daughter can project her voice to any individual she has personally met. Distance is no object,but it must be night wherever the target presently is.The vampire can sing, talk, or otherwise project hervoice in any way she sees fit (including other uses ofMelpominee), but she cannot hear what she is saying,and therefore suffers a +1 difficulty to any rolls accompanying her utterance. For instance, the vampire couldproject her voice to an enemy in an attempt to intimidate him, but would suffer a +1 to the difficulty of theCharisma + Intimidation roll.System: The player rolls Wits + Performance (difficulty 7) and spends a blood point. Each success allows one turn of speech; three or more successes allowspeech for an entire scene.

	3:Madrigal

	*Music has the power to sway the listener, engendering specific emotions through artful lyrics, poundingcrescendo, or haunting melody. The Daughters of Cacophony can tap into music’s power, forcing listenersto feel whatever they wish. The emotion becomes sopowerful that the listener must act, though what a listener does isn’t something the Siren can directly control.System: The player rolls Charisma + Performance(difficulty 7). Each success instills the chosen emotionin a fifth of the Kindred’s audience (more than five successes have no additional effect). The Storyteller decides precisely which members of the audience are affected. Characters may resist this power for the durationof the scene with the expenditure of a Willpower point,but only if they have reason to believe that they are being controlled by outside individuals. The song thevampire sings must also reflect the emotion she wishesto engender — no one’s going to mob the concert security no matter how well she si
ngs “High Hopes,” butthey might if she performs “I Predict a Riot.”

	4:Siren’s Beckoning

	*The Daughters of Cacophony don’t spread madnessas surely (or as visibly) as the Malkavians, but theirsongs are definitely detrimental to one’s sanity. Withthis power, the Daughter can drive any listener to madness. Most of the time, the victim is too fascinated torealize that he should leave the area and block out themusic from his mind.System: Siren’s Beckoning requires an extended,resisted roll. The player rolls Manipulation + Performance (difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpower); the victim resists with a Willpower roll (difficulty equal to the singer’s Appearance + Performance).If the singer accumulates five more successes than thevictim at any point, the hapless soul acquires a newderangement or Psychological Flaw of the Storyteller’schoice. This derangement normally lasts for one night,with an additional night per success over five. Witha total of 20 net successes, the Daughter can make itpermanent.Multiple Daughters may use this Discipline in concert. A
ffected individuals should act in accordance withtheir Natures — enraged Conformists would join a riotbut not start one, aroused Bravos may force their attentions on the object of their desire, and jealous Directors may send cronies after their rivals. Multiple Daughters may use this Discipline in concert.

	5:Virtuosa

	*Most of the low-level Melpominee powers can onlybe used on one target at a time. When the Daughterreaches this level of mastery in her Discipline, she can“entertain” a wider audience. Each member of the audience hears the same message.System: The Daughter may use Phantom Speaker orSiren’s Beckoning on a number of targets equal to herStamina + Performance. The player must spend oneblood point for every five targets beyond the first.

	6: Shattering Crescendo

	*The Daughter can sing powerfully enough to rendflesh, split skin, and crack bone. While some Kindredunfortunate enough to witness this power make refer-ence to the fact that even mortal singers can shatterglass at the right frequency, others note that volumeand intensity don’t seem to matter when a Daughteremploys Shattering Crescendo. The Siren can sing asoothing lullaby and still kill a target. System: Use of this power requires that the victimbe within hearing range (characters with hearing difficulties — or Heightened Senses — are affected at thesame range as other victims). The player spends oneblood point and rolls Manipulation + Performance(difficulty of the target’s Stamina + Fortitude). Eachsuccess inflicts one health level of aggravated damage,which may not be soaked. If using this power on an inanimate object, the Storyteller determines how manydice (if any) the object may use to “soak” and howmany successes are needed to completely shatter it. Multiple Daught
ers may use this Discipline in concert.

	7: Persistent Echo

	*The Daughter can sing, speak, or even use a Melpominee power and leave the effect hanging in the air,waiting for someone to come along and hear it. Thecharacter can control who can trigger her latent song,meaning that combined with Shattering Crescendo orSiren’s Beckoning, this power can be used as a trap.System: The player rolls Stamina + Performance(difficulty 8) and spends a blood point. Each successyields one turn of speech that may be left to be heardlater. If the player wishes to time-delay another Melpominee power, the roll for that power must be madeat +1 difficulty. The echo stays suspended for a maximum number of nights equal to twice the vampire’sStamina + Performance before fading.The Kindred may choose to make the echo audible toanyone who stands in her position for the duration of thepower — in effect, an endlessly looped mystic recording.Conversely, she may choose for it to fade away once itis heard for the first time. She may also choose to leaveit dormant unti
l activated by the presence of a specificindividual with whom she is familiar. If the echo is madea one-time-only effect, all traces of the power disappearonce the vampire’s words echo to the intended recipient.If a character uses Heightened Senses in an areawhere an “unactivated” echo exists, he will hear a faintmurmur. Three successes on a Perception + Occult roll(difficulty 8) are necessary to hear the message, and abotch on this roll will deafen the listener for the restof the night.Multiple Daughters may use this Discipline in concert.



--Mytherceria

	*Whatever odd commingling of blood which produced the Kiasyd has led to a number of weird effects,not least of which is the Mytherceria Discipline. Thiscollection of powers mimics the abilities of faeries —or at least, that’s the best guess of the Kindred who arefamiliar with it. The Kiasyd use this power to alter andbeguile the minds of their foes, as well as to force othersto tell the truth. The Kiasyd do not, in general, teachthis Discipline to those outside the bloodline, and supposedly it would require oaths sworn on the lifebloodof the student to learn.

	1:Folderol

	*The Kiasyd can cleave truth from lies. The exact effect varies from vampire to vampire. Some Kiasyd experience bleeding from the eyes or ears when they heara lie, while some Weirdlings’ eyes glow when told afalsehood. Whatever the effect, this power detects lies,not mistakes, meaning that a target has to know he islying in order for this power to work.System: The character knows when a target is deliberately lying. No roll or expenditure is necessary forthis power to work, but the character must deliberatelyactivate it. Note that this power does not provide anyinsight into what the truth might be, nor does it enablethe vampire to tell if a target is simply stating something false that he believes to be true.

	2:Fae Sight

	*The Kiasyd’s knowledge of magic isn’t just theoretical. Their strangely-colored eyes are capable of detecting the arcane energies of the fae, as well as magic fromother, more esoteric sources. They are not, however,capable of using this power to detect the residue ofghosts or vampiric magic.System: The Kiasyd sees faeries and other faetouched mortals for what they really are, with no rollrequired. Additionally, the player can detect any formof magic that does not stem from ghosts or the undead,including magic from mages, werewolves, and othersuch odd sources. The character can recognize thesefor what they truly are, provided he has seen similareffects before.

	3:Aura Absorption

	*The Kiasyd is capable of seeing images of events andemotions past by touching an object or an area. However, unlike the Auspex Power The Spirit’s Touch, this power absorbs the images, making them harder forother beings with similar powers to access. Anyone attempting to use this power, Spirit’s Touch, or a similarability to see what the Kiasyd has seen finds that theimages are hard to hold, slipping through his mind’seye like minnows through a stream.System: The player must make a Perception + Empathy roll. The difficulty is determined by the Storyteller based on the age of the impressions and themental and spiritual strength of the person who leftthem. The number of successes determines the amountof information gained, both in terms of images of thescene when the object was being held or touched, andthe nature of the person who was holding the object.One scene-type image and one aspect of the person’sidentity (Nature, Demeanor, aura, name, sex, or age)becomes clear for each
 success the player garners onthe roll. Anyone attempting to use this power or TheSpirit’s Touch on the same object subsequently mustaccumulate more successes than the Kiasyd did to getany impression at all. The first Kiasyd’s successes subtract from the number of successes scored by anyonetrying to read the object thereafter.

	4:Chanjelin Ward

	*The vampire inscribes a ward on an object, a location, or a person. That ward disorients and befuddlesanyone that sees it, meaning that even if an intrudercan penetrate a Weirdling’s security and steal an objectof value, he’s unlikely to be able to find his way to theexit. Spiteful Kiasyd use these wards as punishment —one story tells of a Weirdling that drew a ward on anenemy’s shirt as dawn approached, and then watched(from safety) as the unfortunate vampire burned in thesun, unable to remember which way to run.System: The vampire creating the ward inscribes thesymbol in a visible location — on a library door, bookshelf, or an individual’s clothing — and the player rollsIntelligence + Larceny (difficulty 7 for inanimate objects, or the subject’s current Willpower +2). Anyoneentering the warded area or touching the warded object loses two dice from her Intelligence dice pools aslong as she maintains contact with or proximity to theward. Additionally, anyone seeing t
he ward becomesaddled and lost unless she succeeds on a Wits + Investigation roll (difficulty 8). The Kiasyd is immune to hisown wards. The glyphs last for a duration indicated bythe number of successes on the Intelligence + Larcenyroll:

		@1 success		One hour

		@2 successes		One night

		@3 successes		One week

		@4 successes		One month

		@5 successes		One year

	5:The Riddle Phantastique

	*The Kiasyd whispers a riddle to an opponent, andthe riddle consumes his mind. The target can do nothing until he solves the riddle, and no one can help him— answers provided by others, even correct answers,fail to counteract this affliction.System: The player rolls Manipulation + Occult(difficulty of the victim’s current Willpower). After asuccessful roll, the victim can do nothing but sit andponder the Riddle until she accumulates three timesthe riddler’s successes. The subject rolls Wits + Occult (difficulty 8, plus or minus the number of derangements the victim has, at the Storyteller’s discretion).She makes this roll as soon as she is told the Riddle,and then once per hour until she has gathered enoughsuccesses. Should the victim botch on a roll to solvethe Riddle, she takes one level of lethal damage as themystical enigma racks her body, and she loses all successes from the accumulated total. This damage cannotbe healed until the Riddle has been solved. The riddlercan e
nd this trance by telling the victim the answer,but no one else can.

	6: Steal the Mind

	*Legends tell of the Fair Folk taking the memories andfaculties of their victims, leaving these hapless peopledrooling idiots for the rest of their lives. While modernthinking is that these stories actually referred to strokevictims, elder Kiasyd display a power with a similar effect. The victim of Steal the Mind loses his memoriesand all knowledge he has accumulated. The Kiasydgains these memories for a short time, and generallyuses this time to inscribe them before they revert tothe original owner… assuming the Weirdling lets thathappen.System: The player selects a mortal or supernatural target and rolls Perception + Subterfuge (difficultyequal to the target’s current Willpower). While theKiasyd has “stolen” her subject’s mind, she retains herown consciousness, but has complete access to all ofthe subject’s thoughts and memories. Subjects have no knowledge that they have been affected in this manner, though any attempts to harm them — by the Kiasyd or anyone else — 
return their wits to them immediately. Subjects have no access to their Knowledgeswhile this power is active, but Talents and most Skills(those that work on muscle memory) are still present.The Storyteller might need to exercise discretion as towhich Abilities are lost. Those who are victims of this power for long periodsof time may starve, though they will eat food presentedto them. The number of successes determines the duration of the effect, though the Kiasyd may return thesubject’s mind at any time before this period ends. Ifthe victim dies before the memories return, the Weirdling keeps them. If the Kiasyd kills the target to keephis memory, the character may need to roll for degeneration (see p. 309) depending on what Path they follow — Kiasyd on Humanity must always roll.

		@1 Success		10 minutes

		@2 Successes		One hour

		@3 Successes		One night

		@4 Successes		One week

		@5 Successes		One month

	7: Absorb the Mind

	*This power, similar to Steal the Mind, allows thevampire to absorb Abilities from her victim. Thesetraits are transferred permanently; the victim loses theknowledge, and the Kindred gains it. Absorb the Mindis an extremely invasive and insidious power, and fortunately only a bare handful of Kindred in the worldknow of it.System: The player rolls Perception + Empathy (difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpower). Thetarget may resist with a Willpower roll (difficulty equalto the Kiasyd’s current Willpower). The difference between the two determines the effect. If the target getsmore successes, he resists completely and the Kiasydmay never use Absorb the Mind on this target again.The Kiasyd, if successful, may select a combination ofAbilities to her satisfaction.Taking some of a victim’s Ability dots may leave aremainder — the Kiasyd need not take all of a subject’sdots in a given Ability. For example, a character withthree dots in Occult, from whom a Kiasyd steals on
e,retains an Occult of 2. If a Kiasyd takes fewer dots than she already has in a given Ability, these points do notserve to raise her own rating. (In the previous example,the Kiasyd would not increase his Occult rating if healready had a rating of one or more, as he took onlyone dot.) If the Kiasyd fails in an attempt to use thispower on a target, no subsequent attempt can be madeon that target for a year and a day.In all cases, the maximum to which the Kiasyd canraise an Ability is the level the target has in that Ability, so if a victim has only one dot in Law and the Kiasydgets 2 successes, she can’t gain 2 dots in Law. Generational restrictions do apply: a Sixth-Generation Kiasydcan have a maximum of seven dots in an Ability, forexample. All losses of Abilities on the part of the victim are permanent, though they may be returned totheir original levels via experience-point expenditure.

		@1 Success		Steal 1 dot

		@2 Successes		Steal 2 dots in one Ability

		@3 Successes		Steal 3 dots in up to two Abilities	

		@4 Successes		Steal 4 dots in up to three Abilities

		@5 Successes		Steal 5 dots in up to four Abilities

	8: The Grandest Trick

	*The Kiasyd can fool himself into believing that he isnot, and has never been, a vampire. This trick lasts fora short time, during which the character gives up allblessings (but loses all drawbacks) of being Kindred.He retains all of his other knowledge, but the magicof the Grandest Trick deftly prevents him from figuring out the truth (notes that explain the truth vanish, knowledge of clues that would lead him to it don’tmake sense, etc.). The Grandest Trick is useful forthrowing vampire hunters off a character’s scent, butalso for gathering information that can only be obtained during the day. Rumors among younger Kiasydalso persist that some elders of the bloodline use theGrandest Trick to meet during the day once every 50years, exchanging documents and letters that, for thatday, make no sense to any of them. It is only after theTrick wears off that they remember who they are andcan read what their Clanmates wrote.System: The player spends eight blood points andmakes a Willpow
er roll (difficulty 9). If this roll issuccessful, the character becomes mortal at the nextsunrise for a duration determined by the number ofsuccesses on the roll. The Kiasyd knows, however sub- liminally, the duration of the power, and he automatically attempts to return to safety, should daylight be aproblem at the power’s end. After this power ends, theKiasyd retains all memories of his brief return to theworld of mortals. During his time as a mortal, the character’s Traits are limited to ratings of 5 (which returnto their original levels when the character becomes avampire again), and the character has no access to herDisciplines. Likewise, the character may not use bloodpoints for any vampiric benefits while mortal.

--Obeah

	*The bloodline known in modern nights simply asthe Salubri is actually descendant of one half of theancient Clan. In bygone nights, one might have spoken of “healer” and “warrior” Salubri. In the modernnights, the last vestiges of the warrior Salubri are theantitribu of the Clan, and practice their Discipline ofValeren (see p. 474). The rest of the bloodline knowthe Discipline of Obeah. This Discipline allows the Salubri to judge and even improve a subject’s health. Asthe vampire grows more powerful, Obeah lets her heala target’s soul directly. It is this power that forms thebasis of the “soulsucker” charge that dogs the bloodlinethese nights.This Discipline gives its practitioners a third eye inthe center of the vampire’s forehead when the Kindredmasters the second level of Obeah.

	1:Sense Vitality

	*With a touch, the Salubri can instantaneously reada target’s injuries. She may learn how much damage atarget has incurred, and therefore make a guess at whatmust be done to save him. This power can also be usedfor diagnostic purposes — useful for a victim who canno longer speak.System: The Salubri must touch the target to see howclose to death she is. He must then make a Perception+ Empathy roll (difficulty 7). One success on this rollidentifies a subject as a mortal, vampire, ghoul, or other creature. Two successes reveal how many health levelsof damage the subject has suffered. Three successes tellhow full the subject’s blood pool is (if a vampire) orhow many blood points she has left in her system (if amortal or other blood-bearing form of life). Four successes reveal any diseases in the subject’s bloodstream.A player may opt to learn the information yielded bya lesser degree of success — for example, a player whoaccumulates three successes may learn whether or nota sub
ject is a vampire as well as the contents of hisblood pool.Alternately, each success on this roll allows the playerto ask the Storyteller one question about the subject’shealth or health levels. “Was he drugged?” or “Are hiswounds aggravated?” are valid questions, but “Did theSabbat do this?” or “What did the Lupine who attackedhim look like?” are not. The Salubri may use this poweron herself if she has injuries but has somehow lost thememory of how the wounds were received.Additionally, at the cost of one blood point, the Salubri may use Empathy for a roll instead of Medicine.

	2:Anesthetic Touch

	*The vampire can ease a target’s pain or place himinto a deep, soothing sleep with nothing but a touch.This power is intended to heal the pain or succor themind of willing targets, but the character can, withsome effort, employ the power against someone whodoes not wish it.System: If the subject is willing to undergo thisprocess, the player spends a blood point and makes aWillpower roll (difficulty 6) to block the subject’s pain.This allows the subject to ignore all wound penaltiesfor one turn per success. A second application of thispower may be made once the first one has expired, atthe cost of another blood point and another Willpower roll. If the subject is unwilling for some reason, theplayer must make a contested Willpower roll againstthe subject (difficulty 8).To put a mortal to sleep, the same system applies.The mortal sleeps for five to 10 hours — whatever hisnormal sleep cycle is — and regains one temporaryWillpower point upon awakening. He sleeps peacefully and doe
s not suffer nightmares or the effects of any derangements while asleep. He may be awakenednormally (or violently).Kindred, including the Salubri herself, are unaffectedby this power — their corpselike bodies are too tied todeath.

	3:Corpore Sano

	*The Salubri can heal wounds with a laying-on ofhands. The subject feels a warm, tingling sensationover the affected areas as pain leaves the body andflesh knits. The vampire’s third eye opens during thisprocess.System: This power works on any living or undeadcreature, but the character must touch the actual injury (or the closest part of the victim’s body, in the caseof internal injuries). Each health level to be healed requires the expenditure of one blood point and one turnof contact. Aggravated wounds may also be healed inthis manner, but the vampire must spend two bloodpoints instead of one for each aggravated health level.

	4:Shepherd’s Watch

	*The Salubri with this level of mastery of Obeah cancreate an invisible barrier between those under hiscare and those who would do them harm. The Salubrihimself must stand among his charges as he generatesthis barrier; he cannot defend them from afar. Enemiesarmed with guns or other ranged weapons can still attack, but none may approach closer than a few paces.System: The player spends two Willpower points.Erecting this barrier is a standard action, but maintaining it from turn to turn or dropping it is a reflexiveaction. The invisible barrier extends to about a 3-yard/meter radius from the character, and no one outsidethat barrier may cross it while she maintains the power.Those within it at its creation may leave and return,however. The barrier moves with the Salubri. It cannot be maintained at a distance.Those who wish to cross the barrier from the outside,whether friendly or hostile, must best the character inan extended, resisted Willpower roll (difficulty equalsthe opponent’s
 current Willpower for the Salubri, andthe Salubri’s current Willpower for the opponent).The opponent may cross the barrier as soon as he accumulates three more net successes than the Salubri.

	5:Mens Sana

	*With this power, the Salubri can heal madness, quieting inner demons and bringing a soul to peace. Indeed, ancient stories of the Salubri state that Saulot used this power to bring sweet, if temporary, relief tohis “brother” Malkav. Other, more recent stories claimthat Saulot caused Malkav’s madness in the first place.System: The player spends two blood points androlls Intelligence + Empathy (difficulty 8). The use ofMens Sana takes at least 10 minutes of relatively uninterrupted conversation. Success cures the subject ofone derangement of the Salubri player’s choice. Thispower cannot cure a Malkavian of his core derangement, though it alleviates its effects for the rest of thescene. A botch inflicts the same derangement on theSalubri for the rest of the scene. This power may not beused by the Salubri to cure her own derangements.

	6: Unburdening the Bestial Soul

	*This power is the leverage that the Tremere haveused for years to tarnish the Salubri’s name. The Warlocks claim that the Salubri use this power to removethe souls of their victims, alter them in horrible ways,or simply consume them and then make mindless slavesfrom the blasted husks. The truth is that the Cyclopsuse this power to rebuild a target’s tattered soul, at theexpense of their own mental fortitude.The Salubri draws the subject’s soul out of his body,and into the vampire’s third eye. There, the vampirerepairs the soul. During this time, the target’s bodyis vacant, but alive. It obeys the Salubri’s commands(and the vampire must command it to eat and drink,or else it will starve — repairing the soul is not a quickundertaking).By a similar process, the character can cleanse aperson, place, or object of demonic or evil influence.This isn’t a simple banishment, however. It is a battle,pitting the Salubri’s moral and spiritual purity againstwhatever malign entit
y is present. If the Salubri losesthe contest, she might lose her own soul in the process.System: This power may be used to draw out the soulof any character except those with Humanity or Pathratings of 1 or 0 or those who follow particularly inhuman Paths of Enlightenment – some souls are beyondredemption. The player rolls Stamina + Empathy (difficulty of 12 minus the subject’s Humanity or Path rating). A botch gives the Salubri the subject’s derangement for the remainder of the scene. The Salubri mustmake eye contact with the subject and the subject mustbe willing to be subjected to this power.A soul drawn out in this manner becomes part of theSalubri’s soul while the healing process takes place. Shemay return it to its proper body at any time. While the soul is within the Salubri, she may spend a permanentWillpower point to restore a point to the subject’s Humanity or Path rating. The Salubri may restore a maximum number of points equal to her Empathy rating,and may not r
aise the subject’s Humanity or Path higher than the sum of his relevant Virtues (for example, acharacter subscribing to Humanity with Conscience 3and Self-Control 3 could not have his Humanity raisedabove 6 in this manner).While a soul is being held by the Salubri, its bodyis an empty husk, comatose or in torpor, with no motivating force within it. A soul whose body is killedimmediately vanishes, its disposition unknown to any(although the Salubri strongly suspect that souls thatvanish in this manner are completely and irreversiblydestroyed). Killing the body of a drawn-out soul maywarrant a Conscience or Conviction roll if the killerknows of the soul’s absence, at the Storyteller’s discretion.If used to draw out a demon, the player spends aWillpower point if the subject is willing and the corrupting agent does not resist (a rare occurrence). If thesubject is possessed by a conscious entity, the demon(or other foreign consciousness) fights the Salubri fordominance. This takes pl
ace via an extended, contested roll of the Salubri’s Humanity or Path versus theopponent’s Willpower (each party’s difficulty is equalto the other’s current Willpower). The winner is thefirst one to achieve three net successes more than theother. If the player fails, the attempt at purificationalso fails. If the player botches, the demon takes overthe Salubri’s body. This purification cannot be used ononeself and has no effect on the Beast or an alternatepersonality.Once the initial removal has been successfully performed, the player spends a second Willpower point.The Salubri thrusts the demon into a nearby item,animal, or person, trapping the demon in the selectedvessel. This must be accomplished within two turns ofthe Purification and the target must be within physicalreach. If this cannot be accomplished, the demon islikely to go free… or find another suitable vessel (suchas the Salubri). If the vampire places the demon ina being who is likely to suffer from its presen
ce, theplayer must make an immediate Conscience or Conviction roll (difficulty 8) if the Storyteller believes thatthe character’s morality would object. A botch, in addition to the normal consequences, releases the demoninto the world.

	7: Renewed Vigor

	*At this level of power, the Salubri no longer has torepair a target’s body wound by wound. With a touchand a moment’s concentration, she can restore thebody to full health.System: The Salubri touches the target and spendsa full turn concentrating. The player spends a point ofWillpower. At the end of the turn, the target is healedof all damage, including aggravated damage. If thecharacter attempts any other action but the laying ofhands during this turn, the Willpower point is lost andno healing occurs. The Salubri can use this power onherself.

	8: Safe Passage

	*The Salubri radiates a non-threatening aura, alteringthe minds of those around her to seem safe, pleasant,and harmless. Crowds unconsciously part for her, pursuers lose interest, and passers-by are willing to provideassistance. In the event that someone does attempt todo her harm, the rest of the crowd may even protecther.System: This power is always activate, though theSalubri can turn it off if she so desires. While Safe Passage is active, anyone in a crowd (defined as more than10 people in close proximity) who wants to harm theSalubri must engage in a contested Willpower roll withthe vampire’s player (difficulty 6). If the pursuer wins,he may do as he wishes. If the vampire wins, her netsuccesses act as a dice pool penalty on any hostile action the pursuer chooses to take. This manifests as lostinterest in the vampire (the pursuers wonders why he ischasing this person rather than doing something moreinteresting).Safe Passage can also assist a Salubri in finding helpor shelter. 
The player rolls Charisma + Expression difficulty 7). Each success reduces the difficulty of a subsequent, appropriate Social roll by one. This affectsonly attempts to gain seemingly harmless or innocentassistance, such as a place to stay or advice on the badparts of town — a Salubri won’t be able to get automatic weapons or low-grade heroin more easily withthis power. The effects of this power last until the nextsunrise. Safe Passage affects only those who know theSalubri casually or not at all. Anyone who has knownher long enough to form an opinion of her cannot betouched by this power.

	9: Unburden the Flesh-Clad Soul

	*Some few Salubri elders can (or could, at least)achieve an understanding of the soul that allowedthem to free it from its fleshly confines. The characterallows a willing subject’s soul to fly free, able to explorethe world as an astral projection and transcend thatexistence whenever it wishes.System: The vampire and a willing subject mustboth enter a deep meditative trance for a minimumof one uninterrupted hour as the Salubri performs theritual necessary to separate soul from flesh withoutdamaging either. During this period, the player spendsa number of blood points equal to twice the permanentWillpower of the subject. At the end of the ritual, thesubject’s body slips into a coma and dies by the end ofthe night. Many Tremere and other cautious Kindredwarn that the Salubri may misrepresent themselvesand convince others to volunteer for a “release” frommortal concerns, when in truth they wish to trap thesoul in another plane of existence.The subject’s soul is released from h
er body and enters the astral plane (such as the Auspex power PsychicProjection on p. 138). This separation is permanentand irreversible. The subject is treated as an astrallyprojecting character in terms of rules mechanics. However, she no longer has a silver cord and no longerneeds one, as she exists independently of her body. Ifshe is reduced to zero Willpower through astral combat, she loses one point of permanent Willpower andre-forms after a year and a day at the place where thispower was used upon her. A character reduced to zeropermanent Willpower is destroyed forever.This power may only be used upon mortals (excluding mages) and vampires who are in Golconda, andthe subject must have a full understanding of what thisritual entails — including its permanence and the impossibility of a reversal. The body of a vampire who isUnbound decays at sunrise. It is possible to drink theblood remaining in the vampire’s body, but no benefitsare gained from an attempt at diablerie. Any a
ttemptto Embrace the body of an Unbound mortal automatically fails. The free-flying soul may choose to dissipate,moving on to whatever awaits beyond death, at anytime (and is therefore not a ghost).The Salubri may use this power on herself, providedshe is in Golconda.



--Ogham

	*The Ogham Discipline is only found among the Lhiannan bloodline; they do not (some say cannot) shareits secrets with those who do not suffer from their line’scurse. All Lhiannan share a splinter of a dark, oncevast, and powerful forest spirit. Ogham allows them totap into that spirit’s power, and into its communionwith free spirits of its ilk.Ogham is a limited form of blood magic; it is neitheras flexible nor as powerful as Tremere Thaumaturgy,nor other Clans’ blood sorcery, but within the boundsset by the Lhiannan’s territorial nature it is quite powerful. Ogham is strongest within a Lhiannan’s hometerritory. More than 50 miles (80 km) from her hometerritory, the difficulty of using Ogham increases by oneacross the board, as the Lhiannan’s own spirit-shardcomes into conflict with unfamiliar local spirit life.

	1:Consecrate the Grove

	*The Lhiannan with this ability can use the powerof her blood to awaken the spirits of plant life in herterritory; they will act in her defense against any unwelcome intruder. Roots tangle feet, grass grasps atboots, trees sway unnaturally in foes’ way, and so on.Typically the Lhiannan slits a wrist and whirls in place,or stabs a palm and walks a spiral pattern through thefoliage that she wishes to awaken.System: The player spends from one to three bloodpoints, and the character must undertake the processdescribed above. One blood point rouses the plant lifein a 10-foot (3-meter) diameter; two blood points doubles that to 20 feet (6 meters); three makes it 40 feet(12 meters). Tracing the desired area takes one turnper blood point spent.When the blood has been sown, the player rolls Charisma + Survival (difficulty 6). If the roll garners evenone success, the plant life animates as the local spiritworld is roused to action. Enemies in the area suffer a -2to all dice pools from distra
ction and physical interference. Additionally, interlopers must make a Stamina+ Athletics roll to avoid three dice of bashing damagefrom the local flora (provided the local plant life is capable of such damage; trees and brambles probably are,but a grassy meadow doesn’t contain the kind of floranecessary for such an assault). Botching this roll causesthe plants to turn on the Lhiannan instead.This power lasts for one scene.

	2:Crimson Woad

	*The Lhiannan traces mystical runes or script on herown body in vitae, inviting spirits of war to infuse herand gird her for battle. While so imbued, she ignoresmany wounds and retains greater control of her mindas the spirits direct her Beast. The Lhiannan can alsolash out at her enemies with a fierce, blood-borne attack.System: The character spends one scene tracingthe woad on her body; this costs one blood point. Theplayer then rolls Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 7).Each success enables the character to ignore one die ofwound penalties from injury. It also subtracts one fromthe difficulty to avoid frenzy or Rötschreck. This ability lasts through one scene. Additionally, if the character receives more than four health levels of damage,the mystic inscriptions are ruined, and the spirits fleeher body.The Lhiannan may also lash out at her enemies, adding the fury of the woad to her attack. The player mayadd the number of successes achieved on the above rollto the number of dice r
olled for damage for a singleclose-combat attack (this ability can only be used onceper application of Crimson Woad).

	3:Inscribe the Curse

	*The Lhiannan inscribes the name of an enemy onher body in vitae, in whatever language or set of symbols she likes. When the name is so inscribed and theLhiannan’s enemy can see it, baleful spirits becomebound to the name and enact a curse upon that enemy.The curse takes effect the moment the victim sees hisname scrawled in blood.System: The player spends three blood points. TheLhiannan must write the foe’s name in blood, and itmust be displayed on a part of her body visible to intended target in order for Inscribe the Curse to takeeffect. The player chooses which curse to enact on thetarget from the list below; the curse takes effect as soonas the target sees his name. He does not need to understand the language used, but if he can comprehendit, he may resist the curse with a Wits + Occult roll(difficulty 8).The curses described below expire when the glyph iserased, worn off, or defaced by the Lhiannan’s takingfour or more health levels of damage. The curse worksdifferently de
pending on where the Lhiannan inscribesthe target’s name. Body: Inscribe the name on arms, legs, or belly. Thevictim’s body becomes ill and weak (+2 to all difficulties on Physical rolls, and all wound penalties areincreased by one die) or, in the case of Cainites, thevictim cannot use blood other than the one point perday necessary to remain active.Mind: Inscribe the name across the forehead. Thefoe becomes confused as parts of his mind become disconnected from one another; he must spend one Willpower point in order to attempt any Knowledge roll oruse any magical ability or Discipline (other than Celerity, Fortitude, or Potence). This Willpower doesn’tbuy him a success on that roll; it simply allows him tomake it.Voice: Inscribe the name on the throat. The victimloses the power of speech; he can grunt or moan, butcannot say any words.Soul: Inscribe the name down the sternum and overthe heart. The subject loses his will to resist the Beast:difficulties to avoid frenzy are increa
sed by two. Nonvampires are overcome by fear. The target must flee theLhiannan’s territory unless he succeeds in a Courageroll (difficulty 8).

	4:Moon and Sun

	*The life of a Cainite is dominated by two celestialbodies: the sun, which she must fear and hate; and themoon, her only safe source of light. A Lhiannan cantrace ancient sigils of those two orbs on her body togain gifts – the spirit of the moon, ever the vampire’sfriend, blesses her by its current phase, while the sun’sspirit wards off some of that orb’s fiery curse.System: The player spends three blood points. TheLhiannan inscribes the desired sigil on her body overthe course of 15 minutes. The sigil can be inscribedanywhere, but must be exposed. The character maychoose to inscribe both the moon and the sun, buteach symbol requires the blood expenditure and 15minutes to trace it. She can also inscribe these sigils onany voluntary subject.The sun emblem protects a vampire from the worsteffects of fire and sunlight. So long as the symbol remains on the character’s body, the player makes aStamina roll (difficulty 8) when afflicted by fire or sunlight. If the roll is successf
ul, the damage is consideredlethal and the player may roll to soak it normally. Thisroll must be made every time the character faces suchdamage. The moon emblem adds one to the difficulties of SelfControl/Instinct rolls to avoid frenzy (but not Couragerolls to avoid Rötschreck). Other effects of the moonemblem depend on the current phase of the moon:New Moon: Add one die to Dexterity and Stealthdice pools.Crescent Moon: Add one die to Wits and Occult dicepools.Half Moon: Add one die to Perception and Subterfuge dice pools.Gibbous Moon: Add one die to Charisma and Expression dice pools.Full Moon: Add one die to Strength and Brawl dicepools.

	5:Drink Dry the Earth

	*The spirit within every Lhiannan is drawn to sitesof mystical energy, whether ancient stone circles, faerie rings, or dragon tracks. That spirit-shard can wrestspiritual energy out of those places of power and useit to aid the Lhiannan. A word of caution, however:stealing too much power from any mystical site rendersit barren and lifeless, much as if the Cainite had consumed the very blood of the Earth. Also, wizards andwerewolves frequent these same sites, and destroyingthese places can rouse their ire.System: The player rolls Perception + Occult (difficulty 8). One success determines if a given locationis a suitable site (a decision generally left in the Storyteller’s hands, though a Lhiannan with a high DomainBackground may have such a site within her holdings).Two or more successes on this roll grants a rough ideaof the site’s power on a scale of 1 to 5. If the characterwishes to tap the power of that location, she must spenda scene and one blood point marking various parts 
ofthe site with sigils of power, keys for her spirit-shard tounlock the location’s energies.Once the site is prepared, the player makes a second,reflexive Perception + Occult roll (difficulty 7). Anysuccesses beyond the site’s power rating are ignored.For each success, the player gains two dice, which shemay add to any dice pools (except those to avoid frenzyor Rötschreck) for the remainder of the scene. Thesedice are gone when used, but the character may tap thesame location again from turn to turn. The player mustmake the Perception + Occult roll each time. Each“drink” of the site’s energies depletes it, however, asdescribed below. The Lhiannan’s spirit-shard is a greedy thing, wearing as it does the garb of a Cainite’s Beast, and drinksthe site’s energies recklessly. A Lhiannan can only garner a number of successes equal to 10 times the site’spower rating, after which point the area turns into abarren wasteland, incapable of sustaining life. This sortof activity 
in particular is certain to attract the attention of Lupines or wizards. A site may replenish itselfover a period of years. However, a site that is tappedwith Drink Dry the Earth at any point during the yearis unable to replenish lost dice at all that year, and ifthe site is completely drained, it is irrevocably dead.

	6: Inscribe the Forgotten Names

	*When the Lhiannan reaches this level of Ogham,she reverses the relationship between herself and herspirit-shard and can dominate and extract information from it. The Lhiannan’s ancient spirit knows thenames of many mythical beings, and it can be bludgeoned into giving the Lhiannan one of those namesso that she may invoke such a creature. These beingsare dangerous, and not to be trifled with. Many are ona par with Methuselahs.Inscribe the Forgotten Names allows its wielder tocommunicate with the being she summons, but it doesnot give her domination or control over that creature.She must appease it in whatever manner she can, andhope that it does not take offense at being called up.System: The player spends three blood points. TheLhiannan must spend one half hour undisturbed asblood oozes from her skin to sate the spirit-shard’shunger. At the end of this time, the player rolls Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 9, or 8 if the characterhas summoned this particular being before). If 
the rollsucceeds, a powerful creature arrives in the immediatevicinity before the end of the current scene.The Storyteller is free to assign game statistics to anycreature summoned. Such creatures have their owndesires and demands, and many do not take kindly tobeing called.



--Sanguinus

	*Sanguinus is the unwholesome Discipline grantedto the Blood Brothers by the Tzimisce who createdthem. A curious relative of Vicissitude, Sanguinus allows vampires who practice it to combine parts of theirbodies, loan them out to others, and coordinate theirminds and appendages. Even low levels of it are unsettling to watch. Use of the higher levels is disgusting,indeed, as flesh parts and exposed organs, atrophied bythe Blood Brothers’ state of undeath, merge and pulse.Mortals observing the spectacle of this Discipline’smore obvious powers must make Courage rolls (difficulty 4), spend a point of Willpower, or flee the areain nausea.

	1:Brother’s Blood

	*A circle of Blood Brothers is closer than any Sabbat pack, any blood-bound pair of vampiric lovers,any ghoul family. The circle shares flesh, mind, and,of course, blood. The members of the circle can spendblood to heal each other’s bodies, no matter how farapart they are.System: The player spends a blood point, which maybe used to heal any member of the circle, regardless ofdistance from the character. The Blood Brother mayalso “bank” blood, spending five points to heal another’s aggravated wound over the course of several turns.This power takes effect automatically; no roll is necessary. Blood spent by another Frankenstein does notcount against the maximum amount of vitae the targetcharacter can spend per turn.

	2:Octopod

	*The Blood Brother circle can donate limbs and organs to one another. This isn’t meant for healing after the battle, but for use during the battle. An opponent facing down the Blood Brothers might see one ofhis opponents grow a second set of legs (making himnearly impossible to knock down), another pair of arms(meaning he can block or parry almost any incomingattack), extra eyes for 360 degree vision, or an extramouth for an greater blood consumption. Of course,the Frankenstein that gives up the organ might be lefta limbless, eyeless, mouthless lump of flesh on the sideof the battlefield, but the Blood Brothers never seemto mind that.System: The “donor” player spends a blood point foreach limb or organ he wishes to loan to the other circlemember. (Only the donor needs to have this level ofmastery of Sanguinus; the recipient may be any othermember of the donor’s circle.) The loaned organs appear at the end of that turn, in whatever location therecipient wishes — eyes on the 
back of heads or on theends of hands have been seen, as have entire heads located between a Blood Brother’s legs. Use of this powerdoes not impart any extra attacks, but it may allow foradditional sensory input, more blood to be consumed in a single turn, or extra hands to hold weapons or pindown foes. Only external organs may be loaned in thismanner — hearts, stomachs, and brains cannot.

	3:Gestalt

	*Blood Brothers share a hive-mind; this ability wasone of the guiding principles behind their creation.The Gestalt power is that hive-mind, the ability of theFrankensteins to coordinate silently and perfectly inbattle, to avoid mind-controlling powers, and to actin unison.System: This power confers several benefits on theBlood Brothers. For this power to work, however, everyBlood Brother in the circle must spend a blood point.If even one member cannot or will not spend a bloodpoint, this power fails. Once a Blood Brother has metthe Final Death, he is no longer a part of the circle, sothe power continues to function among the still-undead members of the group. Gestalt lasts for one scene.While this power is active:• Dominate, Presence, and the like take effectagainst the highest Willpower rating in the circle. Forexample, if a vampire attempts to Dominate a BloodBrother under the influence of Gestalt, she must rollagainst the highest Willpower rating any of the vampires in the circl
e possesses, even if her subject has thelowest Willpower rating in the circle. Additionally, aBlood Brother affected by powers in this manner dropsout of the Gestalt, though Gestalt remains active forothers. This mental “fuse” was supposedly created toprevent the entire circle from being Dominated by avampire looking into the eyes of one Blood Brother.• Perception difficulties for all Blood Brothers in thecircle decrease by three, as they share the sensory inputof other vampires in the circle.• By taking no action other than concentrating, aBlood Brother may “loan” an Ability to another brother. For example, a wounded vampire with Melee 4 maystep out of combat and loan a circle-mate with Melee2 his mastery of that Skill. The “borrowing” vampiremakes Ability checks against the loaned Trait as if itwere his own.• The Blood Brothers in the Gestalt may communicate through telepathy, allowing them to coordinateactions. In game terms, only one initiative roll is madefor th
e circle, based on the character with the highestinitiative rating (see p. 271).Not all Blood Brothers in the circle need to havethis level of Sanguinus to benefit from the Gestalt. If a given character does not know this power, though,the player rolls Wits + Occult (difficulty 7) when thepower is enacted. If this roll fails, the character canstill receive loaned Abilities, but gains no other benefits from the Gestalt.

	4:Walk of Caine

	*The sorcerous theory behind the Blood Brothersreads like a philosophical treatise on the nature of individuality, free will, and hematology. The Frankensteins are not a group of vampires but are one vampirein several bodies, or so goes the theory. As such, anyof their characteristics must be viewed as a continuum— they are not individually Twelfth, Eleventh, andThirteenth Generation, for example, but they are collectively Ninth Generation at any given time. Whilethe metaphysics of this kind of thinking makes mostvampires’ heads ache, there seems to be something toit. A Blood Brother can draw strength from his circle,lowering his Generation to allow for greater feats ofvitae expenditure.System: Each member of the circle can “donate” onestep in Generation. In the example listed above, thevampire of Eleventh Generation could take one stepfrom his two circle-mates and drop to Ninth, but thevampire of Thirteenth Generation couldn’t drop lowerthan Eleventh. No matter how big the
 circle, no BloodBrother can drop to an effective Generation lowerthan Fourth. Likewise, a Thirteenth Generation BloodBrother can drop to an effective Generation of Fourteenth, which carries with it the penalties listed for theFourteenth Generation Flaw (p. 481). (He cannot goto Fifteenth Generation, however.)As with Gestalt, only one Blood Brother needs toknow this power in order to begin the process. Anythat don’t have Walk of Caine need to make a Stamina+ Awareness roll (difficulty 7). If this roll fails, theymay not participate in the action.

	5:Coagulated Entity

	*The Blood Brothers merge into a fleshy, bleedingmound of horror. This juggernaut surges forward, crushing and consuming anything in its path. The Sabbathas learned to its chagrin that if the Blood Brothers arenot explicitly told to separate after using this power,they won’t. This merger is, apparently, what the BloodBrothers truly want.System: Every vampire in the circle who wishes tobecome part of the Coagulated Entity spends three blood points. Three turns after the process begins, themonster is complete and able to act. The vampire ofthe lowest Generation who is part of the constructguides the creature’s actions. The actual Generation ofthe creature itself, however, is the highest Generationof any vampire present in the construct, less one foreach additional vampire present in the construct. (Using the previous example, the Eleventh-Generationvampire would be the guide but the highest Generation is 13, so the overall Entity would be 13 minus 2, orEleventh Generation.)The crea
ture’s Strength, Stamina, and Perceptionare equal to the guide’s, with a +1 for every additionalvampire contained within. (Generational limits do notapply to this creature — through sheer size, a Coagulated Entity may have a Strength of 7 or more.) Allphysical actions undertaken by the monstrosity gainone extra die to the pool for each vampire beyondthe first present in the construct (before splitting dicepools).Only one vampire in the circle needs to possess Sanguinus at Level Five for this power to work. Body partstend to shift during the creation of a Coagulated Entity — fanged maws at the ends of hands and eyes atopfleshy stalks have been reported by terrified survivors.Storytellers should feel free to give any bonuses (orpenalties) to the construct as they see fit.A Coagulated Entity may not be staked, as it hastoo many hearts in unconventional places for any butthe blindest luck to impale. It has a vampire’s normalseven health levels, plus two for each additional vampi
re who becomes part of the entity (treat these extrahealth levels as Bruised). The entity remains congealedfor one scene, unless the Storyteller wishes to rule thatno one told the Blood Brothers to separate.



--Spiritus

	*The Discipline of Spiritus opens the vampire up toworlds and vistas — and methods of feeding — thatmost Kindred can never touch. Vampires are spiritually dead, unable to create life. The shamanic ritualthat created the Ahrimanes, though, allowed a spiritual connection between the undead and the vast, livingworld all around them. While the vampire can barelyscratch the surface of what living shamans can accomplish, the Discipline of Spiritus is still formidable.

	1:Aid from Spirits

	*Spirits are everywhere, but invisible to most living(and unliving) beings. This power allows the vampireto briefly rouse the spirit of an object, making that object perform its intended function better and more efficiently. It in no way makes the spirit well-disposedtoward the vampire — not that this usually matters tothe Ahrimane.System: The character touches the object, and theplayer spends a blood point and rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty 6). If the roll succeeds, the player receives abonus to her dice pool using that item, equal to the number of successes rolled. For example, if the character usesthis power on a gun and the player rolls three successes,she then receives a +3 to her next Firearms roll made withthat gun. Unused bonuses fade at the end of the scene,and multiple uses of this power do not combine (the mostrecent use trumps any previous uses). The character can,however, use the power on multiple objects she uses inthe same scene, so long as she has the blood
 for it.

	2:Summon Spirit Beasts

	*The vampire might not fully understand the link between “animal” and “animal-spirit,” but spirits of aggressive animals are usually more than willing to takeon a physical body and fight for the vampire. Spirits ofcurious animals, meanwhile, seem to enjoy unlockingdoors or following people. With this power, the Ahrimane can summon up the spirit of an animal indigenousto the area and send it to do what comes naturally.The spirit assumes the corporeal form of the appropriate animal, and is capable of whatever the animalwould normally be able to do. The animal can followsimple telepathic commands, and is slightly more intelligent than a normal animal would be (but still notas intelligent as a person).System: The animal summoned must be native tothe area — just because the local zoo hosts a tigerdoesn’t mean there are tiger-spirits running about. Theplayer must spend one blood point and roll Charisma+ Animal Ken (difficulty 7). The number of successesindicates how long the sp
irit remains material. Thespirits have the same number of health levels theirphysical counterparts would normally have (see p. 388for some sample animals traits). If they are reduced toIncapacitated, they discorporate.

		@1 Success		One Turn

		@2 Successes		Five Turns

		@3 Successes		One Hour

		@4 Successes		One Night

		@5 Successes		One Week

	3:Aspect of the Beast

	*Instead of calling up animal spirits, the vampirelearns to emulate aspects of those spirits herself. In thisway, she can become faster, stronger, tougher, or gainthe special powers of nearly any animal, provided thatthe spirit is local to the area.System: The player spends a blood point and rollsManipulation + Occult (difficulty 7). The power lastsfor one turn per success, unless otherwise noted. Someexamples of aspects are given below, though the playerand Storyteller are welcome to make up others:Beaver’s Bite — This makes the Ahrimane’s bitestrong and sharp enough to cut through almost anysubstance (though it does no additional damage to living or unliving targets).Chameleon’s Colors — The Ahrimane becomes capable of changing color to suit the environment (-2difficulties to all Stealth rolls involving hiding).Ears of the Hare — The Ahrimane can hear as wellas a rabbit, reducing the difficulty of Perception rollsinvolving hearing by two.Falcon’s Eye — The Ahrimane 
can see great distances as if she had the eyes of a falcon (-3 to all Perceptionrolls involving vision).Ferocity of the Cougar — All Courage rolls are madeat -2 difficulty.Leapfrog — This grants the Ahrimane the ability toleap three times the normal height and distance. (Seep. 260 for jumping rules.)Nose of the Hound — The Ahrimane’s sense of smellis far greater than that of a mortal. She can even trackby scent with on a Perception + Survival roll (difficultyset by Storyteller).Serpent’s Venom — The Ahrimane’s bite transmitsa venomous toxin that causes two health levels ofdamage in living victims per turn (see “Poisons andDrugs,” p. 301). The damage continues until the toxinis removed or nullified, or until the Ahrimane’s spiritpower ends.Sound of the Cricket — This grants the power to produce an annoying, grating sound loud enough to deafenthose nearby. The target suffers a +4 to all Perception rolls related to hearing for the next scene unless he succeeds on a 
Willpower roll (difficulty 7).Squirrel’s Balance — The Ahrimane can move aboutin the branches and limbs of trees or across tightropeswith little fear of falling. All such Athletics rolls havetheir difficulties decreased by two.Strength of the Bear — This gives the Ahrimane twoextra dots of Strength.Swiftness of the Stag — The Ahrimane can move attwice her normal running speed.

	4:Engling Fury

	*Spirits abound — supposedly everything, from one’sshirt to the very air, has one. The Ahrimane can takethose spirits into herself, break them down, and refreshher own mental reserves. This destroys the spirit, butno repercussions have been reported.System: The player rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty 8). Every success allows her to regain apoint of Willpower, but each use of this power destroysanother spirit.

	5:The Wild Beast

	*The Ahrimane grows leaner, lithe, and strong. Shehunches over slightly, her eyes become slitted and catlike, and she grows vicious claws on her hands. Herfeatures become slightly feline, and in this form she isan even more formidable predator than usual. Animalsreact with fear to the Wild Beast, and mortals see heras a monster — if they see her at all.System: The change does not require a roll, butthe player must spend two blood points. The changeraises the vampire’s Strength by three, and Dexterityand Stamina each by two. Appearance falls to 0 andManipulation is reduced by three. The vampire’s fangsinflict an extra die of damage, and she grows claws thatinflict aggravated damage. The character can see in thedark, and all difficulties involving scent, hearing, andvision fall by two. The character can retain the WildBeast form for a number of hours every night equal toher Willpower rating.



--Temporis

	*The True Brujah bloodline claims a peculiar Discipline that allows them some control over the flow oftime. Masters of Temporis often grow ever more detached from the passage of ages. This, combined withthe natural tendency for Sages to grow emotionally and spiritually distant, makes True Brujah elders exceptionally dangerous. They know that all life is finite,and so they feel no compunction about ending it.

	1:Hourglass of the Mind

	*Masters of Temporis value patience and clarity. Timeis too complex and dangerous to manipulate incautiously or on a whim. Thus, the first power of Temporisfocuses entirely on perception and serves as a permanent alteration of a vampire’s senses.System: Once purchased, this Discipline gives avampire a perfect sense of time. The vampire knowsevents to the nearest second or better. Moreover, theCainite knows whenever the flow of time is mysticallydisturbed by use of Celerity, greater levels of Temporis, mortal wizardry, or stranger things. Sensing disturbances is instinctive and reflexive, though it requiresa successful Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 6for most phenomena, as modified by the Storyteller fordistance and intensity).

	2:Recurring Contemplation

	*A vampire with this power may trap a target’s mindinto reviewing a set of events over and over until interrupted. This power is extremely subtle and ill-suitedto combat or other situations rich in sensory stimuli.However, a cunning vampire can trick a sentry intoreliving the tedium of his uneventful watch even asthe Cainite draws close enough to strike or slip past.Other uses include the maddening infliction of déjàvu to induce paranoia or make a victim question hersenses and her sanity.System: The vampire concentrates on a single victim in his line of sight. The player rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty equal to the victim’s currentWillpower). With any successes, the victim falls intoa light trance and relives the most recent experiencesthat preceded her fugue. Alternately, the vampire mayevoke another set of specific memories and circumstances from the victim’s past, provided that he hassome means of telepathically drawing them forth. Therecurring events must be relat
ively benign, insofar asnothing noteworthy happens or nothing happens thatwould demand the victim’s immediate action. Thus, inthe example of the sentry, the vampire could entrancehim and walk past unobserved, but not if the sentryspotted him before invoking the power. Ordinarily,the fugue lasts one minute per success. If the vampire’splayer spends a blood point to fuel this power, determine the trance’s duration according to the followingchart:

		@1 success		one minute

		@2 successes		10 minutes

		@3 successes		one hour

		@4 successes		six hours

		@5+ successes 		one day

	**Entranced victims are oblivious to their surroundingsand the actual flow of time around them. However, thefugue ends immediately if the victim suffers any damage or experiences a sudden jolt to her senses, such as athunderclap or even a gentle nudge. Normal conversation does not break the trance, although shouting does.

	3:Leaden Moment

	*With this power, a vampire may begin to alter the flowof time itself rather than mere perception of events. Thevampire gestures and slows the desired object almost toa dead stop. This power can slow incoming bullets tothe pace of drifting clouds, or cause an enemy warrior tosee the battlefield quicken to a blur of dizzying carnageeven as his every motion slows to a crawl.System: The player spends one blood point and rollsIntelligence + Occult. The difficulty depends on thesize and nature of the target: a single thrown brick isonly difficulty 4, while a crazed ghoul has a difficultyof 9. Targets larger than an adult human cannot beaffected with Leaden Moment. It is possible to affectsmall, closely grouped inanimate objects of the samenature as a single object, though this increases the difficulty by two or more at the Storyteller’s discretion (ahail of bullets might be difficulty 9). This power maybe activated reflexively as a defensive action againstprojectiles, but otherwise requ
ires a full action on thevampire’s initiative. Though failure carries no specialpenalty apart from wasting blood, a botch means thevampire mistakenly slows himself rather than the target, counting every 1 as a success for that purpose.If the vampire succeeds, the object slows to one-half itstrue speed. Every two successes beyond the first reducethis speed by one additional factor, so three successesslows the target to one third its speed, five successesyields quarter speed, etc. The actual mechanics of suchslowing depend on the situation. For projectiles, multiply any successes to hit and final damage by the speedfactor, rounded down. Similarly apply the speed modifier to the successes of other actions involving Dexterity, Wits, or Strength for slowed characters. Characterswith Celerity may spend one blood point to negate onefactor of speed reduction at the expense of the usual extra action provided – for example, one blood pointcancels a reduction to one half speed, two blood poi
ntscancel one third, etc. Leaden Moment lasts one turn forevery two successes rolled, rounded up.

	4:Patience of the Norns

	*The vampire can now suspend an inanimate object intime, keeping it frozen in perfect stasis as time passes atnormal speed around it. As with lesser Temporis powers, this stasis has both combat and non-combat applications. True Brujah warriors may halt bullets outrightrather than merely slowing their approach or casuallysidestep a collapsing building. Higher-level variationson this power preserve precious scrolls and artifactswithout risk of mold or decay. If any solid object ornontrivial volume of liquid touches a frozen object thatdid not touch it at the moment of suspension, the itemre-enters time with the same properties and velocityas when it stopped. Thus, touching a suspended objectwith anything more substantial than a raindrop releases it exactly as it was before it stopped.System: The player spends two blood points and rollsIntelligence + Occult (difficulty 6). The vampire mustbe able to perceive the object that he’s suspending, sothe player may need to make a Perception +
 Alertnessroll at a difficulty determined by the Storyteller in order to freeze fast-moving objects. If an object exceedsthe speed of mortal perception, superhuman perception such as Auspex is required in order to see and stopit (as such, bullets can be stopped with this power, butonly if the vampire has at least a dot of Auspex). Objects frozen by this power remain halted according tothe number of successes rolled:

		@1 success		one turn

		@2 successes		one minute

		@3 successes		10 minutes

		@4 successes		one hour

		@5 successes		one day

		@6+ successes 		one week per success over 5

	**Suspended objects retain all energy in their suspension, releasing none to the outside universe. A suspended knife has no kinetic energy as far as the rest ofthe world is concerned and hangs suspended in mid-airuntil the power is interrupted or the duration expires.Suspended alchemical or chemical processes also halt,including fire. However, any physical contact more substantial than a falling raindrop breaks the suspension.

	5:Clotho’s Gift

	*With this power, a vampire momentarily acceleratestime through himself. In this brief instant, he moveswith the preternatural speed of Celerity. Unlike thatDiscipline, however, the time dilation of Clotho’s Giftpermits any type of action. A vampire may still moveor strike faster than the eye can see, but also think,plan, and even invoke other Disciplines that requirefull concentration. Only the last presents a danger, asit overtaxes the vampire’s unliving stasis.System: The player spends three blood points androlls Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 7). For a numberof turns equal to half the vampire’s Temporis rating,rounded up, the character may take a number of extra actions at her full dice pool equal to the numberof successes rolled. These actions follow the timingrules associated with Celerity, but may be used to takeany action. A vampire may use the actions granted byClotho’s Gift to activate Disciplines multiple times,even Disciplines that cannot be used more than once
in a turn (such as Dominate or Thaumaturgy). However, for every action spent activating a Discipline, thevampire suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage.Only one important exception exists: Any attempt tostack extra actions through Celerity, subsequent applications of Clotho’s Gift or other powers results in immediate Final Death, as the vampire collapses into ashas though burned by the sun.

	6: Kiss of Lachesis

	*True Brujah with this power gain limited masteryover the physical age of objects and individuals. Itis a trivial matter to accelerate time in a compressedrush, aging a target decades or even centuries in theblink of an eye. It is far more difficult to absorb andunweave entropy, lessening time’s hold. This powerdoes not reverse history in any way; it merely reversesor accelerates the effects of time in terms of wear andtear. Moreover, a target cannot regress to an earlier orincomplete state of being. For inanimate objects, thisis the point at which they were assembled. For livingbeings, it is either adult maturity or the time of birth(or its equivalent). For the undead and other corpses,it is the moment of death.System: In order for the vampire to age a target, theplayer spends two blood points and rolls Manipulation+ Occult. The difficulty equals the target’s true physical age in decades or effective physical age in the caseof target’s that have aged unnaturally, such as by me
ansof this power. This difficulty cannot rise higher than 10 or drop below 4. The vampire touches the target andconcentrates for a turn. The Cainite may age the targeta maximum number of years as determined by the following table, although his player may choose to applya lesser effect. The Storyteller remains the final arbiterof time’s effect on an object, but living beings aged pasttheir natural lifespan quickly perish.

		@1 success		up to one year

		@2 successes		up to five years

		@3 successes		up to 10 years

		@4 successes		up to 50 years

		@5 successes		up to 100 years

		@6+ successes 		up to one century per success over 5

	**Removing the effects of time requires greater effort,increasing the difficulty of the activation roll by one.In addition, the vampire suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage for every success her player choosesto apply. As noted, objects cannot return to an earlieror incomplete state. A silver coin may lose its tarnishand seem newly minted, but it will not revert to anunformed block of metal. Likewise, while an adult mayrevert to the cusp of his adulthood or a child to a newborn, neither could regress to a prenatal state. Also,this power only accounts for damage and wear due totime. A child amputee reverted to a baby will not regenerate her missing arm, nor will a broken sword become anything but finely crafted shards.In either application, this power does not change asubject’s mental or mystical properties. Sentient beingsretain all memories and any derangements. A vampireregressed to the point of death remains a vampire, notan inanimate corpse — and the regressed Cainit
e stillremembers all Disciplines and keeps any changes inGeneration due to diablerie. However, a vampire agedfar enough pales considerably or loses any signs of diablerie from his aura.

	7: Cheat the Fates

	*Where a vampire with Clotho’s Gift may acceleratewith respect to the world, a vampire with this powermay step outside of time entirely. During this brief sojourn, the Cainite perceives the world frozen at a standstill. He can walk about at a leisurely pace to sidestepblows or retreat without being observed. He may evenexert force, such as by striking a blow, though no damage is resolved until he re-enters time. However, thispower wreaks terrible destruction on a vampire’s unliving body. Used incautiously, a vampire may saunter outof time, only to fall to ash when he returns.System: The player spends one Willpower point andthree blood points, and then rolls Wits + Occult (difficulty 7). This power may be activated reflexively asa defensive action; however, such hasty use reducesthe maximum duration to a single turn. Failure doesnothing apart from wasting effort and blood, while abotch inflicts one level of aggravated damage for every1 rolled.If successful, the vampire steps out o
f time for a number of turns equal to the successes rolled (outside ofcombat, a turn still only lasts three to five seconds forthe purposes of this power). These turns occur for thevampire only while the rest of the world stands still.He may take any action or actions during this time,as many as desired, but he has no access to Disciplines— even innate or perpetual Disciplines such as Potence. The vampire must direct every aspect of Caine’sCurse toward holding back time. If the vampire attackssomeone in this state, the target cannot dodge or parry.Resolve the attack normally but do not apply damage.However, if the vampire suffers injury, such as by exposure to sunlight or walking through a frozen flame,apply this damage immediately.The vampire may end his sojourn at any point or waituntil the full duration of the power passes, at whichpoint time resumes. Before anything else happens, including resolution of damage inflicted by the vampire,roll one die for every turn the vampire mo
ved out oftime. The difficulty is equal to the vampire’s Temporisrating. For every success, the Cainite suffers one levelof unsoakable aggravated damage. Apply this damageconcurrently with damage suffered by halted victimsand continue play on the same turn and initiative thevampire stepped out of time.

	8: Clio’s Kiss

	*One of the most subtle manifestations of Temporis’higher levels, this power allows a vampire to reach intothe past and summon events, objects, or even individuals. Clio’s Kiss, named for the muse of history, is thepower to bypass the flow of time and bring something— or someone — forward to the present. Some TrueBrujah scholars use this to observe history as it trulyoccurred, while others look to the past for aid or toretrieve lost possessions. At least two coordinated attempts by the True Brujah to summon their Antediluvian progenitor have met with catastrophic failure. No one knows if a Sage capable of this power remains.The hope is that Clio’s Kiss faded from knowledge —the bloodline cannot afford a third attempt.System: The player spends half of the character’scurrent blood pool, rounded up, and rolls Stamina +Occult (difficulty 8). This power automatically failsif the player spends fewer than five blood points. Thenumber of successes determines the maximum amounto
f time through which the character may reach:

		@1 success		24 hours

		@2 successes		one month

		@3 successes		one year

		@4 successes		10 years

		@5+ successes 		one century per success over 4

	**When a vampire uses this power successfully, thescene she seeks to retrieve materializes around her,briefly supplanting the current environment. Thischange extends to a maximum volume of a ballroom orsimilarly proportioned outdoor space (at Storyteller’sdiscretion). The power affects everyone inside this areaby granting them awareness of the summoned events,but the vampire is the only person who may choose tointeract with the scene (though he may remain invisible and disembodied). All others must remain incorporeal observers until time reasserts itself and the scenefades. They may move about to change their vantagepoint, but can take no other action.If the vampire wants to remove an object or individual from the scene, bringing them forward to the present,the player must spend a dot of Willpower. Once this isdone, the conjured scene fades away and present realityreturns. Only the summoned object or person remains.This power can never alter the course of history inany significant 
manner. Should an object or personhave a meaningful role yet to play at the time it is removed, the weight of time crashes upon the vampireand he vanishes in its current. Whether such folly results in destruction or propels the vampire far into thefuture remains unknown and likely unknowable. Likewise, any changes the vampire makes to a summonedscene unravel as soon as he departs. Like a play, timemay be altered by the removal of extras, but the scriptstays the same — however cruel a fate, Carthage mustbe destroyed.As always, the Storyteller remains the final judgeof what this power can achieve and need not reveal all limitations until a vampire attempts a change. Itis possible to summon a person from a point close tohis death, assuming he perished without observers.Likewise, a manuscript destroyed when the Library ofAlexandria burned can be called after it is last read.Calling the very library from Alexandria would be impossible, not only for its size but also the necessity andsign
ificance of its ruins. Finally, the previous form of acurrently existing object cannot be summoned, if onlybecause its continued existence validates a role in history. Storytellers need not consider every ramificationof paradox, but this power has tremendous potentialfor abuse and should be adjudicated accordingly.

	9: Tangle Atropos’ Hand

	*This manifestation of Temporis is at once the mostflagrant and subtle twist of time — the power of secondchances. The existence of such power is only a theoryand a fearfully whispered rumor, for who can ever knowwhen or how time itself unraveled and changed?System: The player spends a dot of Willpower andthree blood points and rolls Wits + Occult (difficulty8). Every additional point of permanent Willpowerspent beyond the first adds one automatic success tothe roll. Use of this power is reflexive and may be doneat any moment, even on a turn in which the vampirehas used other Disciplines. If successful, the Cainite’smind flashes back to his earlier self with full memory ofthe events that transpired and now only might transpire.This rewind encompasses one turn for every successrolled, and inflicts an equal number of levels of unsoakable aggravated damage. Assuming the vampire doesnothing, every event plays out exactly as before. Oncethe vampire takes a new action of any sort, time
 shiftsto encompass a new future and fate is no longer fixed.



--Thanatosis

	*This Discipline is an exclusive development of theSamedi bloodline, and it is tied intrinsically to theStiffs’ identity and history. Although Thanatosis appears to deal closely with death and the energies ofdecay, no Giovanni have ever claimed mastery of thispower. Outsiders assume the Giovanni must be interested in learning this Discipline. However, the Giovanni view the Samedi with distrust and loathing,while the Samedi take on the Giovanni is usually expressed by muttering a curse on the Clan and spittingblood. Thus, the possibility of an exchange of information approaches nil.

	1:Hag’s Wrinkles

	*Perpetual rot makes the character’s flesh malleable.The Samedi can open large folds in her flesh, storingobjects in them like a kangaroo’s pouch. She can alsomassage the slimy flaps of fatty tissue to alter her appearance slightly (though this does nothing for thesmell). Other Kindred can learn this Discipline, ofcourse, but if they do not possess the “advantage” ofhaving skin that already falls in droops and folds, largewrinkles and bulges may be visible.System: This power requires one turn to shape thewrinkles and the expenditure of a blood point. If thepower is used to distort a character’s features, theSamedi player must roll Stamina + Subterfuge (difficulty 8). Success raises the difficulty to visually identifythe character by one and lasts for one hour per successrolled. If the character is attempting to hide a smallobject (a wallet, a letter, a small pistol), the roll andduration are the same, but all rolls made to see if theobject is detected (for example, a pat-do
wn search or asecurity guard’s visual inspection) are at +2 difficulty.

	2:Putrefaction

	*The character can, with a touch, inflict decay upona target. Hair falls out, teeth loosen, flesh rots and fungus grows on the skin. This power works on targets living and undead, and is obviously quite unsettling bothphysically and psychologically.System: This power first requires that the charactertouch his intended target. The player then rolls Dexterity + Medicine (difficulty of the target’s Stamina +Fortitude) and spends a blood point. Success inflictsone health level of lethal damage on the target andremoves one point of the victim’s Appearance. ThisAppearance loss returns to vampires at the rate of onepoint per night, but is permanent for mortals (thoughplastic surgery can correct mortals’ physical disfigurement). If a mortal suffers three or more health levels ofdamage from repeated uses of this power in one scene,gangrene or other ailments may occur.Putrefaction can also be used on plants, in whichcase the target becomes blighted and withered. It cannot, however, be us
ed on inanimate objects such ascars or wooden stakes.

	3:Ashes to Ashes

	*The character collapses into a thick, sticky whitepowder. While in this form, the character cannot moveand is only dimly aware of her surroundings, but is immune to fire and sunlight (meaning that this power is an effective escape in some situations). The charactermust take care, though — if the ashes are scattered, shemight never be able to reform.System: The transformation to ashes requires oneturn and the expenditure of two blood points. Whilethe character is in ash form, the player must make aPerception + Alertness roll (difficulty 9) for any scenein which she wishes her character to be aware of hersurroundings. Reforming from the heap of ashes takesone turn. If the character is in a confined space (suchas an urn), she explodes from it in a suitably dramaticmanner as she brings herself back to full size. If a Samedi is scattered while in this form, one health level andone blood point are lost for each tenth (roughly) of thecharacter that has been dissipated. Five blood pointsa
re required to heal each health level lost in this manner. At the Storyteller’s discretion, the Samedi may bemissing limbs or vital organs (though never the head orthe heart) until the missing health levels are healed.

	4:Withering

	*The Stiff can shrivel and render useless an opponent’s limb. This power works on Kindred as well asmortals. Kindred, of course, are horrified by the power,as they tend to think of their bodies as immortal andinvulnerable to such ravages.System: The Samedi must touch the limb he intendsto shrivel. The player spends a Willpower point androlls Manipulation + Medicine (difficulty equal to thevictim’s Stamina + Fortitude). Three successes are required for this power to shrink a limb. With one or twosuccesses, the victim takes one health level of bashingdamage, which may be soaked normally, but is otherwise unaffected. (If the Withering attempt is successful, the subject suffers no health level of damage, butrather the withering of the limb itself.)The effects of Withering fade after one night if a vampire or other supernatural creature is the victim, but mortals (including mages) are permanently afflicted unlesssome type of supernatural healing is used. If this poweris used on an arm
 or leg, the limb instantly becomes useless. If this power is used on an opponent’s head, mortalvictims die instantly. Kindred lose two points from allMental Attributes while their heads are shrunken andare unable to use any Disciplines except Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence. Multiple uses of this power on thesame appendage have no additional effect.

	5:Necrosis

	*A more horrific and potent form of Putrefaction, thispower causes flesh to decay and slough off, exposingthe bone beneath. Use of this power can render an opponent unable to move from lack of muscle tissue. System: The Samedi must make contact with thevictim. The player spends two blood points and rollsDexterity + Medicine (difficulty of the target’s Stamina+ Fortitude). The victim takes a number of health levels of lethal damage equal to the number of successesrolled and suffers additional effects as listed below.

		@1 success		No additional effects

		@2 successes		Lose one point of Appearance

		@3 successes		Lose a point each of Appearance andDexterity

		@4 successes		Lose a point each of Appearance,Dexterity, and Strength

		@5+ successes 		Lose two points of Appearance and one each of Dexterity and Strength

	**Attributes lost in this manner are regained when alldamage from the Necrosis attack is healed. If a victimis reduced to zero Strength or Dexterity, he is unableto move except for weak flailing and crawling but maystill use Disciplines and spend blood points normally.

	6: Creeping Infection

	*Rumors state that Samedi, especially elders, are infectious, that their presence or touch causes a wasting disease. This power might be the source of theserumors. Creeping Infection allows the Samedi to usePutrefaction, Withering, or Necrosis, but prevent theDiscipline from taking effect until the Samedi is wellaway. This power allows for subtle curses, or insuranceagainst someone who might hire the Samedi and thenrefuse to pay up.System: The player must successfully roll for a useof Putrefaction, Withering, or Necrosis, as above, andmay delay the effect for a number of months equal tothe Samedi’s Stamina. The player may spend a bloodpoint at any time during this period in order to activatethe dormant power. If the Creeping Infection is notused before the end of its duration, it fades away withno effect.

	7: Dust to Dust

	*With this power, the Samedi retains cohesion, awareness, and mobility while in ash form. While not as impressive as the Tzimisce Horrid Form, a clever Stiff canfind many tactical uses for such a power. System: While a pile of ash, the Samedi remains fullyconscious and may use any Discipline powers that beinga pile of dust would permit (for instance, Majesty willmake the pile of dust very impressive, and no maid inher right mind would dare sweep it up). The charactercannot be blown apart by high winds, and any deliberate attempt to separate the pile of ash may be resisted with a die pool equaling the character’s combinedStrength, Stamina, Potence, and Fortitude. The character may move voluntarily at a speed no higher thanthat at which a pile of normal dust would be blown bythe wind, even if he is indoors. He does not have tomove in the direction of the prevailing air currents, andmay “flatten” himself by spreading his ashes thinly soas to slip under doors and through cracks. Th
is powerfunctions like Ashes to Ashes in all other respects.

	8: Putrescent Servitude

	*The practice of creating zombified servants is an oldone in vodoun, though most powerful Samedi can perform feats of reanimation that put the finest hounganto shame. The Stiff can raise a recently dead person asan undead servant. The zombie can’t think critically ormove faster than a quick walk, but it is tough, strong,and unquestioningly loyal.System: The first application of this power allowsthe Samedi to feed some of her blood to a recently deadcorpse (maximum time since death equal to the Samedi’s Stamina in weeks) in order to animate it. Threeblood points must be spent to bring the corpse back toa semblance of life. A reanimated corpse has the samePhysical Attributes as it did in life. It is capable of limited reasoning (reduce all Mental Attributes by one),but free thought is beyond it and the only person it canclearly understand is its master or an individual whoits master has directed it to obey. Reanimated corpsespossess two levels of Fortitude and three extra healthlev
els. They suffer no dice pool penalties from woundsuntil they lose their last health level, at which pointthey collapse and cannot be reanimated again.A reanimated corpse crumbles to dust at the thirdsunrise after its creation. Its “lifespan” can be extendedby feeding it more blood at creation — one blood pointper extra night.This power can also be used on a mortal. The Samedicreates a ghoul in the normal fashion, by feeding thesubject one blood point. The player then rolls Manipulation + Medicine (difficulty equal to the mortal’s permanent Willpower). Three or more successes are requiredto turn the mortal into a zombie. If this roll succeeds,the mortal loses all free will, becoming completely subjugated to the Samedi’s command. The mortal may tryto break free once per night by rolling his Willpower(difficulty equal to the Samedi’s Manipulation + Leadership). If the mortal frees himself, he is still considereda ghoul but regains his free will and normal Mental andSocial At
tributes (see below). A mortal who botcheshis Willpower roll or who becomes blood-bound to theSamedi may never again attempt to break free. A mortal under the influence of Putrescent Servitudebecomes pale and corpselike. He loses one point fromall Social and Mental Attributes (to a minimum valueof one). He gains three extra health levels and takesno dice pool penalties from injuries until he reachesIncapacitated, at which point he collapses. One morelethal wound will kill him once he reaches this point.The mortal also gains one level of Potence, as a normalghoul would, and has the potential to learn other Disciplines if the Samedi feels inclined to teach him. A ghoul zombie who goes a month without vampiric blood loses all benefits of being a ghoul, as wouldnormally occur. He also loses all effects of this powerand regains his free will, though he may still be bloodbound to his master.



--Valeren

	*Valeren is a warrior’s Discipline, a holdover from thenights when warrior Salubri acted as noble fighters andKindred knights. The Discipline is still applicable tothe modern nights, but the Salubri antitribu put it todecidedly more vicious ends.Like Obeah, Valeren imparts its practitioners withthe fabled third eye of Saulot. The third eye appears atthe time the vampire masters the second level of Valeren. The precise nature and purpose of the eye are allbut unknown to vampires outside the Salubri antitribu.Some suspect the eye grants them sight beyond sight,while others venture that the eye allows them to see theinfernal taint in the non-Sabbat Salubri themselves.

	1:Sense Vitality

	*A healer learns a subject’s illnesses to cure them. TheSalubri antitribu, however, learn how close to death atarget is so that they may hasten the process. System: This power works identically to the Obeahpower of the same name (p. 457).

	2:Anesthetic Touch

	*The Salubri antitribu can ameliorate a subject’s pain,allowing him to bolster a ghoul’s effectiveness in combat. This power can also put a mortal to sleep, whichhas obvious applications for escaping human scrutiny(though the Fury is probably just as likely to kill themortal in question).System: This power works identically to the Obeahpower of the same name (p. 458).

	3:Burning Touch

	*The character’s hands bring searing pain, as thoughthe target is being burnt with red-hot metal. Althoughthe power does not inflict actual damage, prolongedor repeated exposure can be enough to traumatize avictim. This power works extremely well as a torturemethod. System: The vampire must touch his subject for thispower to take effect, and the effects diminish rapidlyafter he removes his hand. The player spends at leastone blood point to activate this power, and each bloodpoint spent reduces the victim’s dice pools by two whilethe Fury is in contact with the victim. This power isoften used for interrogation or torture, wearing downthe subject’s resistance and rendering him much moretractable.

	4:Armor of Caine’s Fury

	*The Salubri antitribu is surrounded by a shining,crimson halo. This phantom armor protects the vampire against most physical injury, as well as againstRötschreck.System: The player spends one blood point and rollsStamina + Melee (difficulty 7). For each success, thecharacter gains one point of armor protection againstbashing and lethal damage, to a maximum of five pointsof protection. Additionally, for every two successesrolled, she gains an additional die to resist Rötschreckfrom the effects of battle (but not fire or sunlight). Thispower works for one scene.

	5:Vengeance of Samiel

	*The Salubri antitribu strikes his foe with superhuman accuracy and strength, as his third eye opens andchanges to a furious, icy blue. Some Furies invoke thenames of ancient Salubri warriors, while others simply close their normal eyes and let Samiel guide theirhands. System: This power costs three blood points. Anysingle attack made by the vampire automatically hits the target as mystic forces guide the blow. Attacksmade in this manner may not be dodged, though theymay be blocked, parried, and soaked as normal. Theblow strikes as if the Salubri antitribu had succeededwith all of his Dexterity + Melee or Brawling dice pool(which makes for significant damage). This power maybe used only once per turn, and only then the Salubriantitribu’s sole action is the attack. Additionally, thispower does not work for ranged weapons; only barehands or melee weapons.

	6: Blissful Agony

	*The vampire may cause pain with a mere touch, asper Burning Touch, but this pain lingers and swellseven after the Fury has removed her hand. It is believed that this power was originally used to acclimatewarrior Salubri to the pain they would experience inbattle, but among the Sabbat Salubri, Blissful Agonyhas been turned to more brutal uses. If applied withenough intensity, Blissful Agony can drive vampires tothe point of frenzy, incapacitate Lupines, and even killmortals outright.System: The player makes a Willpower roll (difficulty 8) and spends a blood point. The power lasts for onescene, though this duration may be prolonged if theSalubri antitribu wishes by making a subsequent Willpower roll (though no additional blood points need bespent). The character must touch her subject for thepower to take effect initially.At the vampire’s option, she may cause actual physical damage to the victim at the rate of one health levelper blood point spent, though touch must be maintained f
or this to happen. Damage to vampires andother supernatural creatures in this fashion vanishes atthe next sunset, but mortals must heal the damage normally. This damage is considered lethal damage, andmortals may not soak it (though vampires and othersupernatural entities may).To induce frenzy in a victim, the Fury must causedamage in excess of the subject’s Willpower. At thatpoint, the subject must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) or succumb to frenzy.



--Visceratika

	*Visceratika is an extension of the Gargoyles’ naturalaffinity for stone and earth. Certain Visceratika powers closely resemble some aspects of Protean and, toa lesser extent, Vicissitude. Tremere in a position to know insist that this is pure coincidence, but the fewamong the Gargoyles who retain scholarly aspirationsinsist that the Gangrel and Tzimisce blood used to create the bloodline still maintains a certain hold over itsmembers.For many years, Visceratika was regarded as endemicto the Gargoyle condition, just like the repulsive visageand the wings with which other Kindred associate thebloodline. That is, vampires — including the Tremere— believed that they couldn’t have the one withoutthe others. Supposedly this isn’t true, and provided onecan find a Gargoyle tutor, any vampire can learn theDiscipline. Of course, that assumes one can find a willing tutor — the Gargoyles aren’t eager to reveal thesesecrets. Furthermore, few Kindred want to bet that theTremere are 
wrong and risk waking up with wings andhorns.

	1:Skin of the Chameleon

	*This basic power has saved countless Gargoylesbreaching the Masquerade — and has allowed just asmany to ambush unsuspecting intruders. When Skinof the Chameleon is in effect, the Gargoyle’s skin takeson the color and texture of the surrounding environment. This coloration changes reflexively as long asthe Gargoyle maintains a walking pace or slower. Morerapid movement causes the Gargoyle’s appearance toblur, negating the camouflaging effect. If this power isused while the Gargoyle is in flight, his skin becomesa reasonable facsimile of the night sky (though it willnot shift to mimic nearby skyscrapers or star patterns,and a black silhouette against a brightly lit skyline islikely to be noticed).System: The player spends one blood point. For therest of the scene, the Gargoyle’s Stealth dice pool is increased by five. This power is subject to the limitationsdescribed above. Any ground movement faster than awalk negates this power’s effect, as does flight (at theStoryteller
s discretion).

	2:Scry the Hearthstone

	*The Gargoyles’ first function for the Tremere wasthat of guardian and watchdog. This power allowsthem to know instinctively where anyone is inside agiven structure. It even allows the Gargoyle to detectcharacters concealed by magical means, if the Slave isperceptive enough.System: The player spends a Willpower point to activate this power, which remains in effect as long as theGargoyle is within or in contact with the target structure, or until the next sunset. Scry the Hearthstone maybe used on anything up to the size of a cave complex, alarge theatre, a parking garage, or a mansion. The character gains an innate sense of the location and approximate size and physical condition of all living (or unliving) beings within the structure. To pinpoint a specificindividual’s location with this power, the player mustsucceed in a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 6).If the subject is attempting to hide, he may oppose thisroll with a roll of Wits + Stealth (difficulty 6).Scry the H
earthstone may be used to detect the presence of characters who are under Obfuscate or similar powers. In this case, the Gargoyle only knows thatthere is someone present — she cannot actually see theindividual in question. To determine the Gargoyle’sability to detect Obfuscated characters, compare therelative levels of the Gargoyle’s Visceratika minus oneand the intruder’s Obfuscate as per the “Seeing theUnseen” sidebar on p. 142.

	3:Bond with the Mountain

	*The Gargoyle sinks into a stone surface, disappearing into the rock until he wishes to reappear. Thispower allowed Gargoyles to invade their masters’ enemies’ strongholds, fight until sunrise, then meld withthe rocks or stone walls and reappear the next evening.In modern nights, it can take the place of a haven foritinerant Runaways. Unlike the Earth Meld power(p. 199) which it resembles, Bond with the Mountaindoes not conceal the Gargoyle completely. A faint outline of his body can be seen in the rock where he hides.System: The player spends two blood points, and themerge takes four turns to complete. This power functions in a fashion similar to the Protean 3 power ofEarth Meld, and may only be performed upon bare rockor a similar substance. However, the Gargoyle does notsink fully into the substance with which he merges,and his outline can be detected within the stone witha successful Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 9).A Gargoyle attacked while Bonded with the Mountain
 has triple his normal soak dice pool against allforms of attack. However, if he sustains three or morelethal health levels of damage from a single attack, heis forced out of his bond and suffers disorientation similar to that experienced by an Earth Melded characterwhose slumber is interrupted.

	4:Armor of Terra

	*At this level of Visceratika, the Gargoyle’s skinhardens and becomes truly rock-like to the touch. TheSlave becomes harder to harm, even with fire, andgrows inured to injury. A non-Gargoyle learning thislevel of Visceratika would find her skin becoming grayand rock-like, putting lie to the claim that the Discipline doesn’t carry the risk of the Gargoyle’s curse.System: This power is automatic and requires no roll;it is always in effect. A vampire with Armor of Terrahas one extra soak die for all aggravated and lethal attacks and two for all bashing attacks, reduces all woundpenalties by one, and halves the damage dice pool ofany fire-based source of injury (this Discipline does notchange the rules for Rötschreck, however). The difficulty of all touch-based Perception rolls is increased bytwo, due to the desensitization of the character’s skin.

	5:Flow Within the Mountain

	*The Gargoyle is no longer restricted to hiding withinstone. Now, he can flow through stone like lava working its way down a mountainside, emerging from thehiding place at any point he wishes. Since this powerworks on cement or concrete as well as rock, the streetsof a modern metropolis afford a Gargoyle some veryinteresting assassination tools.System: Once the character has used Bond with theMountain, the player spends two more blood points toactivate Flow Within the Mountain for the durationof the scene. The Gargoyle can move within stoneand cement (otherwise using the same rules as theProtean power Earth Control, p. 200). The charactercan also use this power to walk through a stone walland emerge on the other side without first using Bondwith the Mountain. In this case, the player spends oneblood point and rolls Strength (difficulty 8; Potenceadds dice or successes normally). The Gargoyle mayflow through a maximum thickness in feet equal to thenumber of successes rolled, or 30 tim
es the number ofsuccesses rolled in centimeters. If the wall or barrier isthicker than this, the character is trapped within it until he is chiseled out or uses Flow Within the Mountainto escape.
