#### Disciplines complexes



----Necromancy

	*Necromancy is both a Discipline and a school ofblood magic devoted to the command of the souls of thedead. It’s similar to Thaumaturgy in that it has several“paths” and accompanying “rituals” rather than a strictlinear progression of powers. The study of Necromancyis not widespread among the Kindred, and its practitioners — primarily the Giovanni — are shunned anddespised for their foul practices (until those practicesbecome useful, of course).Over the centuries, the various schools of vampiricNecromancy have evolved and diversified from an earlier form of death magic, leaving several distinct pathsof necromantic magic available to Cainites. Nearly allmodern necromancers learn the Sepulchre Path firstbefore extending their studies to other paths. The primary Necromancy path increases automatically as thecharacter increases her overall Necromancy rating.Other paths must be bought separately, using the experience costs for secondary paths. Like Thaumaturgy, Necromancy ha
s also spawned aseries of rituals. While not nearly so immediate in effect as the basic powers of Necromancy, Necromanticrituals can have impressive long-term effects. Unsurprisingly, the elements of Necromantic ritual are thingslike long-buried corpses and hands from the cadaversof hanged men, so obtaining suitable materials can bequite difficult.System: A Cainite necromancer must learn at leastthree levels in his primary path before learning his firstlevel in a secondary Necromancy path. He must thenmaster the primary path (all five levels) before acquiring any knowledge of a third path.As with Thaumaturgy, advancement in the primarypath costs the normal experience amount, while studyof additional Necromantic paths incurs an additionalexperience-point cost (see p. 124). Because Necromancyis not quite so rigid a study as Thaumaturgy is, the rollsrequired to use Necromantic powers can vary from pathto path and even within individual paths. The commonly-learned Sepulchre Path is presen
ted first, with the remaining paths presented in alphabetical order.Statistics for ghosts may be found in Chapter Nine,p. 385.



---The Sepulchre Path

	*Through the Sepulchre path, the vampire can witness, summon, and command the spirits of the dead.At higher levels, the necromancer can force the ghostto remain in a particular place or object, or even damage wraiths directly. Since many other areas of Necromancy involve dealing with ghosts, this is the mostcommon path for necromancers to start with.Note: If a Kindred uses a Sepulchre Path power inthe presence of something of great importance to theghost the power affects, the chances for success in thesummoning increase dramatically (reduce the difficultyby 2). This might be the bathtub in which the ghost’smortal body was drowned, the rusted-out wreck of thecar where the ghost’s physical body was trapped alive,or something unrelated to the ghost’s demise, such as afavorite book or a child-ghost’s beloved nursery.

	1:Witness of Death

	*Before it is possible to control the dead, one mustperceive them. This power allows just that, attuninga vampire’s unliving senses to the presence of the incorporeal.

	2:Summon Soul

	*The power of Summon Soul allows a necromancer tocall a ghost back from the Underworld, for conversational purposes only. In order to perform this feat (andindeed, most of the feats in this path), the vampiremust meet certain conditions:• The necromancer must know the name of thewraith in question, though an image of the wraith obtained via Witness of Death (see above), Shroudsight(see p. 163), Auspex, or other supernatural perceptionwill suffice.• An object with which the wraith had some contactin life must be in the vicinity, though it need not besomething of significant importance to the ghost’s living consciousness. A piece of the ghost’s corpse workswell for this purpose (and even provides a -1 difficultymodifier).Certain types of ghosts cannot be summoned withthis power. Vampires who achieved Golconda beforetheir Final Deaths, or who were diablerized, are beyondthe reach of this summons. Likewise, many ghosts ofthe dead cannot be called — they are destroyed, unable to
 return to the mortal plane, or lost in the eternalstorm of the Underworld.

	**Under its effects, a necromancer sees ghosts as translucent phantoms gliding among the living and hearstheir whispers and moans. She feels the spectral coldof their touch and smells their musty hint of decay. Yetone cannot mistake the dead for the living, as they lacktrue substance, and appear dimmer and less real thancreatures of flesh and blood. When a vampire uses thispower, her eyes flicker with pale blue fire that only thedead can see.Ghosts resent being spied upon, and more powerfulshades may use their own powers to inflict their displeasure on the incautious.System: The player rolls Perception + Awareness(difficulty 5). Success allows the vampire to perceiveghosts as described for the rest of the scene (in themortal world — seeing ghosts in the land of the deadrequires Shroudsight, on p. 163). Failure has no specialeffect, but a botch means the vampire can see only thedead for the scene; everything else appears as shapeless,dim shadows. While the vampire’s other senses r
emainattuned to the living, he is all but blind in this stateand suffers a +3 difficulty to most vision-based Perception rolls and attacks. Ghosts notice the glowing eyesof a vampire using this power only with a successfulPerception + Alertness roll (difficulty 7).

	**System: The player spends one blood point and rollsManipulation + Occult (difficulty equal to 7 or theghost’s Willpower, whichever is higher). The vampiremust know the name of the ghost and have on hand anobject the ghost had contact with in life. Provided thatthe target has died and become a ghost, success meansthe shade appears before the necromancer as describedabove. Not everyone becomes a ghost — it requires astrong will to persevere in the face of death, and soulsthat have found peace pass on to their eternal rewards.Moreover, it is possible for the dead to suffer spiritualdissolution and destruction after they become ghosts.The Storyteller should consider all these factors whendeciding whether a particular ghost exists for a vampireto summon.Vampires know if their summons should have succeeded by a feeling of sudden, terrifying descent as theyreach too far into the great Beyond, so this power canbe used to determine whether a soul has endured beyond death. While a failur
e means the vampire wastesblood, a botch calls a spirit other than the one sought— usually a malevolent ghost known as a Spectre (seep. 385). Such a fiend torments the one who summonedit with every wicked power at its disposal.Once a ghost is summoned, it may not deliberatelymove out of sight of the vampire, though it can takeany other actions, including direct attack. The vampire’s player may spend a Willpower point to dismissthe ghost at any time (unless he rolled a botch). Otherwise, at the end of the scene, shadows engulf the spiritonce more and return it to its original location.

	3:Compel Soul

	*With this power, a vampire can command a ghost todo his bidding for a while. Compulsion of the soul is aperilous undertaking and, when used improperly, canendanger vampire and wraith alike.System: The vampire locates and approaches the intended ghost or calls it to his presence with SummonSoul. As with the previous power, he must have theghost’s name and an object it handled in life. His playerthen spends one blood point and rolls Manipulation +Occult in a resisted roll against the ghost’s Willpower(difficulty 6 for both rolls).If the vampire wins, the number of net successes determines the degree of control he has over the ghost(as described below). Moreover, the vampire’s controlkeeps ghosts that have been called with Summon Soulfrom returning to their original locations at the end ofthe scene. If the ghost wins, the vampire loses a number of Willpower points equal to the ghost’s net successes.On a tie, the roll becomes an extended contest thatcontinues each turn until one
 side wins. If the vampirebotches at any point, the ghost is immune to any useof the vampire’s Necromancy for the rest of the scene.If the ghost botches, it must obey as if the vampire’splayer had rolled five net successes.

		@1 success		The ghost must perform one simpletask for the vampire that does notplace it in certain danger. It mustattend to this task immediately,although it can delay thecompulsion and pursue its ownbusiness at a cost of one Willpowerpoint per scene. The ghost may notattack the vampire until this task iscomplete. It is possible to issue thetask of answering one question, inwhich case the ghost must answertruthfully and to the best ofits knowledge.

		@2 successes		The vampire may issue two ordersor ask two questions as outlined forone success. Alternatively, thevampire may demand a simple taskwith a real possibility of danger, aslong as the danger is not certain. Theghost may delay this compulsion withWillpower.

		@3 successes		The vampire may issue three ordersas outlined for one success.Alternatively, he may demand theghost fulfill one difficult anddangerous task or a simple assignmentthat has an extended duration of upto one month. The ghost may delaysuch orders with Willpower.

		@4 successes		The vampire may issue four orders,as outlined for one success, orassign two tasks, as for two successes.Alternatively, the vampire maycommand the ghost to perform onecomplex assignment that puts theghost at extreme risk, or perform anynumber of non-threatening tasksas the vampire’s slave for up to onemonth (or, if the necromancer spendsa permanent point of Willpower, for

		@5+ successes		The vampire may issue multiple orders that have a sum complexityor danger of five successes’ worth.Instead, the vampire may order theghost to perform any one action thatit is capable of executing within onemonth. Such a task can place theghost in immediate peril ofdestruction, or even force it to betrayand assault loved ones. It is notpossible for ghosts to delay a task ofthis magnitude with Willpower —they must obey. a year and a day). It is possible for ghosts to delay individual tasks, butnot put off enslavement.

	4:Haunting

	*Haunting binds a summoned ghost to a particularlocation or, in extreme cases, an object. The wraithcannot leave the area to which the necromancer bindsit without risking destruction.System: The player spends one blood point whilestanding at the location for the haunting or touchingthe intended prison. She then has the ghost brought toher by whatever means she desires, though SummonSoul is quickest and most reliable. Her player thenrolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty is equal to thetarget’s current Willpower points if resisted, to a minimum of 4; otherwise it is 4). The difficulty rises by oneif the vampire wishes to place the ghost in an object.As usual, the difficulty decreases by one if the necromancer has a part of the spirit’s corpse in addition toknowing its name (minimum difficulty 3).Each success binds the ghost within the location orobject for one night. This duration extends to one weekif the player spends a Willpower point or a year and aday for a dot of permanent 
Willpower. A wraith attempting to leave the area of a haunting must make anextended Willpower roll (difficulty 9, four cumulativesuccesses necessary in a single scene) or take a level ofaggravated damage for each roll. If the wraith runs outof health levels, it is hurled deep into the Underworldto face destruction.

	5:Torment

	*It is through the use of this power that powerful necromancers convince bound ghosts to behave — or else. Torment allows the vampire to strike a wraith as if hehimself were in the lands of the dead, inflicting damage on the wraith’s ectoplasmic form. The vampireremains in the real world, however, so he cannot bestruck in return.System: The player rolls Stamina + Empathy (difficulty equal to the wraith’s current Willpower points),and the vampire reaches out to strike the wraith. Eachsuccess inflicts a level of lethal damage on the wraith.Should the wraith lose all health levels, it immediatelyvanishes into what appears to be a doorway to somehideous nightmare realm. Ghosts “destroyed” thus cannot reappear in or near the real world for a month.



--The Ash Path

	*The Ash Path allows necromancers to peer into thelands of the dead, and even affect things there. Of thepaths of Necromancy, the Ash Path is the most perilous to learn, because many of the path’s uses increase anecromancer’s vulnerability to wraiths.

	1:Shroudsight

	*Shroudsight allows a necromancer to see through theShroud, the mystical barrier that separates the livingworld from the Underworld. By using this power, thevampire can spot ghostly buildings and items, the landscape of the so-called Shadowlands, and even wraithsthemselves. However, an observant wraith may noticewhen a vampire suddenly starts staring at him, whichcan lead to unpleasant consequences.System: A simple roll of Perception + Awareness(difficulty 7) allows a necromancer to utilize Shroudsight. The effects last for a scene.

	2:Lifeless Tongues

	*Where Shroudsight allows a necromancer to seeghosts, Lifeless Tongues allows her to converse withthem effortlessly. Once Lifeless Tongues is employed,the vampire can carry on a conversation with the denizens of the ghostly Underworld without spending bloodor causing the wraiths to expend any effort.System: To use Lifeless Tongues requires a roll ofPerception + Occult (difficulty 6) and the expenditureof a Willpower point.

	3:Dead Hand

	*Similar to the Sepulchre Path power Torment, DeadHand allows a necromancer to reach across the Shroudand affect a ghostly object as if it were in the real world.Ghosts are solid to necromancers using this power, and can be attacked. Furthermore, the necromancercan pick up ghostly items, scale ghostly architecture(giving real-world bystanders the impression that he’sclimbing on air!), and generally exist in two worlds.On the other hand, a necromancer using Dead Hand isquite solid to the residents of the Underworld — andto whatever hostilities they might have.System: The player spends a point of Willpower andmakes a successful Wits + Occult roll (difficulty 7) toactivate Dead Hand for one scene. For each additionalscene the vampire wishes to remain in contact withthe Underworld, he must spend a point of blood.

	4:Ex Nihilo

	*Ex Nihilo allows a necromancer to enter the Underworld physically. While in the lands of the dead,the vampire is essentially a particularly solid ghost. Hemaintains his normal number of health levels, but canbe hurt only by things that inflict aggravated damageon ghosts (weapons forged from souls, certain ghostlypowers, etc.). A vampire physically in the Underworldcan pass through solid objects in the real world (at thecost of one health level) and remain “incorporeal” fora number of turns equal to her Stamina rating. On theother hand, vampires present in the Underworld aresubject to all of the Underworld’s perils, including ultimate destruction. A vampire killed in the realm of thedead is gone forever, beyond even the reach of othernecromancers.System: Using Ex Nihilo takes a tremendous toll onthe necromancer. To activate this power, the vampiremust first draw a doorway with chalk or blood on anyavailable surface. (The vampire may draw doors aheadof time for exactly this purp
ose.) The player must thenexpend two points of Willpower and two points ofblood before making a Stamina + Occult roll (difficulty 8) as the vampire attempts to open the chalk doorphysically. If the roll succeeds, the door opens and thevampire steps through into the Underworld.When the vampire wishes to return to the real world,he merely needs to concentrate (and the player spendsanother Willpower point and rolls Stamina + Occult,difficulty 6). At Storyteller discretion, a vampire whois too deeply immersed in the Underworld may needto journey to a place close to the lands of the living inorder to cross over. Vampires who wander too far intothe lands of the dead may be trapped there forever.Vampires in the Underworld cannot feed uponghosts without the use of another power; their onlysustenance is the blood they bring with them.

	5:Shroud Mastery

	*Shroud Mastery offers the Kindred the ability tomanipulate the veil between the worlds of the livingand the dead. By doing so, a necromancer can makeit easier for bound wraiths in his service to function,or make it nearly impossible for ghosts to contact thematerial world.System: To exercise Shroud Mastery, the necromancer expends two points of Willpower, then stateswhether he is attempting to raise or lower the Shroud.The player then makes a Willpower roll (difficulty 9).Each success on the roll raises or lowers the difficultiesof all nearby wraiths’ attempts to cross the Shroud inany way by one, to a maximum of 10 or a minimum of3. The Shroud reverts to its normal strength at a rate ofone point per hour thereafter.



--The Bone Path

	*The Bone Path is concerned primarily with corpsesand the methods by which dead souls can be restoredto the living world — temporarily or otherwise.

	1:Tremens

	*Tremens allows a necromancer to make the flesh of acorpse shift once. An arm might suddenly flop forward,a cadaver might sit up, or dead eyes might abruptlyopen. This sort of thing tends to have an impressiveimpact on people who aren’t expecting a departed relative to roll over in his coffin.System: To use Tremens, the necromancer spendsa single blood point, and the player must succeed ona Dexterity + Occult roll (difficulty 6). The more successes that are achieved, the more complicated an action can be effected in the corpse. One success allowsfor an instantaneous movement, such as a twitch, whilefive allow the vampire to set up specific conditions under which the body animates (“The next time someoneenters the room, I want the corpse to sit up and openits eyes.”). Under no circumstances can Tremens causea dead body to attack or cause damage.

	2:Apprentice’s Brooms

	*With Apprentice’s Brooms, the necromancer canmake a dead body rise and perform a simple function.For example, the corpse could be set to carrying heavyobjects, digging, or just shambling from place to place.The cadavers thus animated do not attack or defendthemselves if interfered with, but instead attempt tocarry out their given instructions until such time asthey’ve been rendered inanimate. Generally it takes dismemberment, flame, or something similar to destroya corpse animated in this way.

	**System: A roll of Wits + Occult (difficulty 7) andthe expenditure of a point of both blood and Willpower are all that is necessary to animate corpses withApprentice’s Brooms. The number of corpses animatedis equal to the number of successes achieved. The necromancer must then state the task to which he is setting his zombies. The cadavers turn themselves to theirwork until they finish the job (at which point they collapse) or something (including time) destroys them.Corpses animated in this way have no initiative oftheir own, and are unable to make value judgments.They respond to very literal instruction. Thus, a zombie could be told “sweep this room every day until allthe dust and cobwebs are gone” or “transcribe thismanuscript” with an expectation of reasonable results,while a more open-ended command such as “fix thismotorcycle” or “research this Necromantic ritual andwrite down the results” would be doomed to failure.Bodies energized by this power continue to d
ecay, albeit at a much slower rate than normal.

	3:Shambling Hordes

	*Shambling Hordes creates obvious results: reanimated corpses with the ability to attack, albeit neither verywell nor very quickly. Once primed by this power, thecorpses wait — for years, if necessary — to fulfill thecommand given them. The orders might be to protecta certain site or simply to attack immediately, but theywill be carried out until every last one of the decomposing monsters is destroyed.

	**System: The player spends a point of Willpower.The player then must succeed on a Wits + Occult roll(difficulty 8). Each success allows the vampire to raiseanother corpse from the grave, and costs one bloodpoint. If the player cannot or chooses not to pay theblood point cost of additional zombies past a certainnumber, the extra successes are simply lost. Each zombie can follow one simple instruction, such as “Stayhere and guard this graveyard against any intruders,”or “Kill them!”Note: Zombies created by Shambling Hordes willwait forever if need be to fulfill their functions. Longafter the flesh has rotted off their mystically animatedbones, the zombies will wait and wait and wait, stillable to perform their duties.

	4:Soul Stealing

	*This power affects the living, not the dead. It does,however, temporarily turn a living soul into a sort ofwraith, as it allows a necromancer to strip a soul froma living body. A mortal exiled from his body by thispower becomes a wraith with a single tie to the realworld: his now-empty body.

	**System: The player spends a point of Willpowerand then makes a contested Willpower roll againstthe intended victim (difficulty 6). Successes indicatethe number of hours during which the original soul isforced out of its housing. The body itself remains autonomically alive but catatonic.This power can be used to create suitable hosts forDaemonic Possession. It has no effect on Kindred orother supernatural creatures (except ghouls) until suchcreatures are dead – in the case of vampires, this meansFinal Death.

	5:Daemonic Possession

	*Daemonic Possession lets a vampire insert a soul intoa freshly dead body. This does not turn the reanimatedcorpse into anything other than a reanimated corpse,one that will irrevocably decay after a week, but it does give either a wraith or a free-floating soul (say, that ofa vampire using Psychic Projection) a temporary homein the physical world.

	**System: The body in question must be no more than30 minutes dead, and the new tenant must agree to inhabit it — a ghost or astral form cannot be forced into anew shell. However, most ghosts would gladly seize theopportunity. Should the vampire, for whatever reason,wish to insert a soul into another vampire’s corpse (before it crumbles to ash), the necromancer must achievefive successes on a resisted Willpower roll against theoriginal owner of the body. Otherwise, the interloperis denied entrance.Note: The soul can use whatever physical abilities(Athletics, Brawl, Potence) his new fleshy home possesses, and whatever mental abilities (Computer, Law,Presence) he already possessed. He cannot use thephysical abilities of his old form, or the mental abilitiesof his new one.



--The Cenotaph Path

	*Practitioners of the Cenotaph Path are primarilyconcerned with discovering or forging links betweenthe living world and the Shadowlands. It functionson the principle that a Kindred, already a corpse, isan unnatural bridge between the living and the dead,and the necromancer can use this to find other, similarlinkages. The basic rudiments of the Cenotaph Pathfunction easily enough once the Kindred learns to attune himself to these connections. Advanced masteryof the path usually entails some brief ritual to forge artificial connections, either through focusing unsavorypassions or commanding this world and the Shadowlands together.

	1:A Touch of Death

	*Just as a necromancer may exert mastery over theShadowlands, so too can some ghosts exert themselves in the mortal world. Whereas obvious displaysof ghostly power such as bleeding walls or disembodiedmoans certainly won’t be mistaken, some ghostly abilities exert subtle effects that aren’t easily recognized.A necromancer sensitized to the residue of the dead,though, can feel whether an object has been touchedby a ghost or sense the recent passage of a wraith.System: The necromancer simply touches a person orobject that he suspects is a victim of ghostly influence.The player rolls Perception + Awareness (difficulty 6).If successful, the necromancer can determine whether a ghost has exerted any sort of power on the subject, oreven crossed nearby, to the duration detailed below.

		@1 success		Last turn; detect use of ghostly powers

		@2 successes		Last three turns; detect use of ghostlypowers

		@3 successes		Last hour; detect ghost’s touch anduse of ghostly powers

		@4 successes		Last day; detect ghost’s touch and useof ghostly powers

		@5 successes		Last week; detect nearby passage ofghost, ghost’s touch, and use ofghostly powers

	**On a failure, the necromancer receives no impressions. A botch reveals a misleading answer (an objectmay seem tinged with ghostly power when it’s not, orvice versa). Should the necromancer succeed in detection while touching an object or person that a ghostis possessing, he immediately becomes aware that theghost is still inside. The impression gained in such acase is sufficient to count as an image of the spirit forpurposes of the Sepulchre Path’s powers, so the Kindred may be able to (for example) immediately command a ghost to exit a person whom it possesses.

	2:Reveal the Catene

	*Necromantic compulsions function much more effectively when the caster uses an object of significanceto the ghost in question. Such fetters tie the dead tothe living lands through their remembered importance— a favored recliner for relaxing, a reviled piece of artfoisted off by hated relatives, or some object of similarlyintense emotion. Many necromancers can detect suchcatene through the use of rituals (see Ritual of the Unearthed Fetter, p. 181). With this power, though, thenecromancer can determine a fetter with just a few moments of handling. The Kindred simply runs his handsover the object and concentrates on it. He quicklyreceives an impression of the item’s (or person’s) importance to wraiths, if any; should the wraith be oneknown to the necromancer, he immediately recognizesthe object as a fetter to that (or those) ghost(s). Successful identification of a connected ghost is not exclusive; that is, if the vampire determines that the objectis important to a given wraith,
 he can also determine ifthere are other ghosts tied to the item, though he mustuse the power again to gain their identities.

	**Many necromancers use this power on objects already identified with A Touch of Death, in order todetermine whether the ghost is trying to attune a givenfetter or simply toying with the world of the living.

	**System: The necromancer holds and examines theobject for at least three turns — if it’s an item, thismeans turning it over in his hands, running his fingers along it, or otherwise giving it a critical eye; witha person, this may require a more… invasive… examination. The player then spends a blood point androlls Perception + Occult (difficulty 7). If successful,the Kindred determines whether the object holds anysignificance to any ghost and, with three or more successes, the identity of at least one such ghost (whichallows the Kindred to use the Sepulchre Path on thatwraith, if desired). If the necromancer already knowsany of the ghosts involved, their ties are revealed withtheir identity — so, if the necromancer already knowsa wraith well enough to summon and compel it withother powers, successful identification of a fetter tellswhether the object is tied to that ghost, in addition toany other impressions gained.

	**If a botch is scored, the necromancer can never successfully use this power on the item being examined.

	3:Tread Upon the Grave

	*The extended awareness granted with the CenotaphPath allows the necromancer to find locations wherethe Shadowlands and the living world come close.Often, the necromancer experiences a chill or shiverwhen stepping into an area where the Underworld liesnear the living one. With practice, the vampire cantell exactly where such locations are.Experienced necromancers learn that certain locations are susceptible to ghostly influence; these haunted areas often become homes of a sort for ghosts. Aknowledgeable vampire can thus discover places wherethe dead are likely to congregate, the better to snarethem with other Necromancy powers.System: The player simply declares intent to sensethe Shroud in an area and makes a Willpower roll(difficulty 8). Success reveals whether the location ishighly attuned to the Shadowlands, about average (notparticularly close to the world of the dead), or far removed from the realm of death. A failing attempt atusing the power has no adverse effect, though it ma
ybe attempted only once per scene (so the necromancermust either wait for a time or move to a different areabefore attempting Tread Upon the Grave once more). A botch stuns the necromancer into inaction for a fullturn and costs him a temporary Willpower point, as heis overcome by shivers and a sense of overwhelmingdespair. With three or more successes, the necromancer candetermine whether the Shroud’s strength has been artificially altered in the area.

	4:Death Knell

	*Not all who die go on to become ghosts — manylack the drive to hang on after death or simply have nooverwhelming needs that compel them to stick around.Normally, even necromancers have no way to sortthose who might become ghosts from the masses whogo on to whatever rewards await. Over time, though, anecromancer can become sensitized to the pull that occurs when a soul escapes from a body only to hover inwait, enslaved by its desires. The weight of desperationbecomes like a tangible tug, and some necromancerssavor this emotion even as they follow the sensation tofind the new ghost.Of course, actually discovering the new ghost can beproblematic. The Kindred may need some means to seethrough the Shroud or may have to send other wraithsto look for the new unfortunate, especially if a largeaccident or massacre leaves too many corpses for thenecromancer to easily discern and test names.System: Whenever someone dies and becomes aghost within a half-mile or kilometer of the necromancer, s
he automatically senses the demise (though manychoose to ignore this “always-on” power unless activelyseeking someone). This power does not automaticallypinpoint the location of the new ghost or identify it,but the player may spend one Willpower point and rollPerception + Occult (difficulty 7) for the necromancerto gain a vague sense of the distance and direction tothe new wraith. With one success, the Kindred maysense a vague pull in a general direction; with threesuccesses, the necromancer can sense the direction andguess distance to within a quarter-mile or half a kilometer. With five successes, the necromancer immediately senses the location of the new ghost to withinone foot or 30 cm. A failure carries no penalty but abotched attempt sends the necromancer scurrying offin the wrong direction.The Storyteller may rule that disturbances in theUnderworld, intervening magic, or other similar phenomena cloud this sensation, simply to prevent overburdening a chronicle with constant g
host-huntingand dice rolling.

	5:Ephemeral Binding

	*The most puissant necromancers learn not only tosense the ties between living and dead, but to forgesuch ties themselves. The master of Ephemeral Binding turns an otherwise mundane object or person into adepository for his own necromantic energy. The undying Curse transforms the subject into a sort of linkagebetween the living and dead. The necromancer smearshis blood on the item in question, which mystically absorbs the vitae and, in doing so, becomes a vessel toanchor a spirit.System: The necromancer must coat an object withhis blood (a full blood point’s worth); if the subject isa person, then that individual must ingest the vitae.The player marks off the blood point, spends a pointof Willpower, and rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty 8). If successful, the item temporarily becomesa fetter to one wraith. If the Kindred already knowsthe name of the wraith or has a strong psychic impression, then the object can become a fetter at any range,even to a ghost who normally does no
t come near theliving world (so long as the ghost still exists). Otherwise, the necromancer must be able to see or sense theghost (with Witness of Death, Shroudsight, or othersuch means).A fetter artificially created in this fashion functionsfor all necromantic and ghostly purposes as a normalfetter: It can be detected with other Necromancy powers, the vampire gains a bonus to Necromancy againstthe wraith attuned to it, and the ghost similarly findsexertion of its powers easier upon the subject (so thevampire might turn an unwitting ghoul into a consortfor a wraith familiar with possession…). The ghost cansink into the fetter to heal; conversely, if the fetter isdestroyed, the wraith is banished to some inaccessibleregion of the Underworld, perhaps never to return.A fetter created with Ephemeral Binding lasts forone night per success scored. The expenditure of an additional point of Willpower increases this duration toa week per success, whereas spending a permanent dotof Willpower 
extends the duration to a year and a day.Botching with this power not only causes failure butalso makes the ghost immediately aware of what thenecromancer was trying to do. Most ghosts do not takekindly to meddling Kindred trying to make artificialchains for them.



--The Corpse in the Monster

	*This path enhances the necromantic understandingof the unliving form and allows the user to fully experience the corpse as a gateway between life and death.The path lets the vampire apply some of a corpse’straits to a vampire, and she can enhance or reducethese traits at various levels of the power.

	1:Masque of Death

	*The character with this ability can assume a visageof death or inflict that shape on another vampire. Thevictim’s flesh becomes pallid and thin (if it is not already), and skin pulls tight against bone. This abilitycan be very useful, as it allows one to hide in plain sightin a tomb or crypt at any time (though the characterremains as vulnerable to sunlight and fire as ever).When a necromancer uses this power on another Kindred, the victim gains the same corpselike demeanor.In this sense, the ability works as something of a minorcurse.

	**System: The player spends one blood point for thecharacter to gain the form described. Those afflicted with the Masque of Death lose two points of Dexterity and Appearance (minimum of 1 in Dexterity and0 in Appearance) for the duration of the power. Theplayer also gets two extra dice to his Intimidation dicepool, should he wish to terrify any onlookers. Further,if the character remains perfectly still, observers mustroll five successes on a Perception + Medicine roll (difficulty 7) to distinguish the character from a normalcorpse. The player doesn’t need to roll anything tohave the character stop moving — vampires have noautonomic functions.If the user inflicts Masque of Death on another vampire, he must spend a blood point, touch the target, andthen make a Stamina + Medicine roll (difficulty equalto the target’s Stamina + 3). The Masque of Death lastsuntil the next sunset, unless the character who createdthe masque wishes to extinguish its effects earlier.

	2:Cold of the Grave

	*The dead feel no pain, though most undead do. Withthis ability, the character can temporarily take on theunfeeling semblance of the dead, in order to protectherself from physical and emotional harm. When assuming the Cold of the Grave, the vampire’s skin becomes unusually cold. When she speaks, her breathmists even in warm air — those with exceptional senses might even see a slight red tinge to the breath.The power brings a sense of lethargy over the character, as a mortal might feel under the influence of amildly unpleasant disease. It becomes difficult to rouseoneself to action, and very little seems importantenough to really worry about. A corpse has no worries,after all.System: The player spends one Willpower point.For the remainder of the scene, the character takes nowound penalties, and the player gains an additional dieto all dice pools that involve resisting emotional manipulation, such as Intimidation or Empathy. However,the player also loses a die from dice pools to em
otionally manipulate others. The character is a cold fish tothose she interacts with, and they do not respond readily to her. The Cold of the Grave does not protect thecharacter against the depredations of the Beast. Shemay be emotionally cold on the surface, but if otherstaunt and anger her sufficiently, she is still subject tofrenzy as normal.

	3:Curse of Life

	*The Curse of Life inflicts some of the undesirabletraits of the living upon the undead, removing their corpselike nature and creating a false life to remindthem of the worst things about being alive. Targets ofthis power regain only the unpleasant aspects of life, asculled from the memory of the Discipline’s user. Thismay include mundane hunger and thirst, sweat andother excretions, the need to urinate and defecate, adecrease in sensory acuity, and a particular vulnerability to attacks that the character might normally shrugoff.System: The player spends one Willpower and rollsIntelligence + Medicine (difficulty 8) to affect a targetwithin line of sight and no farther than 20 yards or meters from the character. If the roll succeeds, the targetsuffers the weaknesses of the living without gaining anybenefit from that state. He does not become immuneto sunlight or holy artifacts, for instance. However, hedoes become badly distracted by mundane needs, withthe net result that his player
 suffers a +2 difficulty penalty to all rolls. He can ignore these distractions at thecost of one Willpower point per scene. Additionally,the victim cannot use blood to raise his Physical Attributes while this power is in effect, and Willpowercannot eliminate this penalty. The power remains ineffect until the next sunset.

	4:Gift of the Corpse

	*This power, one of the most potent on the Corpsein the Monster path, enables a necromancer to ignoremost of her race’s inherent weaknesses for a short time.A dead body is not particularly vulnerable to sunlight,holy artifacts, frenzy, or being staked through the heart,after all, and so it is with a vampire using the Gift ofthe Corpse. As with the Cold of the Grave, above,the character using this power takes on an even moredeathlike mien. It lasts for less than a minute, typically, but that time may be enough to enable a characterto charge through a burning building without fearingfrenzy or instant death.System: The player spends one Willpower and rollsStamina + Occult (difficulty 8). For every success, thecharacter can spend one turn in a state in which he ismore akin to an animated corpse than a vampire. Holyartifacts and sanctified ground have no effect, and thecharacter is immune to frenzy and Rötschreck. Sunlight does only bashing damage, and then only if bareskin is exposed 
on a clear day. Being staked throughthe heart is only as much of a danger as getting stabbedthrough his dead spleen would be. Fire harms him onlyas it would a mortal — causing lethal damage insteadof aggravated. Should the character end the power’s duration whileexposed to any of the aforementioned harmful things,he immediately takes their full effect. If he is staked, hebecome immobilized; if he is on or near fire, he beginsto take the damage a Cainite should take, and he mustimmediately roll against Rötschreck.

	5:Gift of Life

	*With the Gift of Life, the character can experiencethe best and most positive things about being alive. Theoverwhelming hunger for blood temporarily abates, allowing the character to consume and enjoy food anddrink. She can also enjoy sex as she wishes, and the sundoes not burn her. The Gift of Life comes with a dark,terrible cost, however. Its use is almost sure to result inthe death of a mortal, as the vampire must expend anenormous quantity of vitae in order to initiate it. TheDiscipline’s effects last until the midnight after thecharacter uses the power, so it is in her best interests touse it just after midnight.System: The player spends 12 blood points, burningas much blood as possible each turn until she meetsthat level. She then rolls Stamina + Occult (difficulty6) and needs only one success for the power to work.A botch has catastrophic effects. The character mightbe instantly killed or might inadvertently Embrace hervictim, for example. If it takes longer than one turnto
 spend the necessary blood to enact this ability, itdoes not take effect until all 12 points have been spent.However, the blood must be spent continuously — thevampire cannot burn five, run off and feed, then burnseven more an hour later. On the other hand, she mayfeed as she activates the power — in one turn she mightburn one blood point while drinking three. Since fewKindred above the Seventh Generation can easily expend such an amount of blood, the most efficient wayto activate this power is to have a human nearby whocan be sacrificed to power the transformation.After her transformation, the character gains manytraits of an ordinary human. She is largely immune tothe scorching effects of the sun (Fortitude difficultiesto soak damage from direct sunlight are halved, andshe takes no damage if she is sufficiently covered), andshe can experience and enjoy many of the fine thingsabout human life. She retains a few of her vampiricbenefits, however. Fortitude and Auspex abilities rema
in in place if she has either of those Disciplines, andthe Storyteller may allow her to retain other Disciplinesas well if he deems them dramatically appropriate. Shealso retains a vampire’s benefits when it comes to handling bashing damage. However, she is still vulnerable to holy artifacts, human faith, and being staked. Herblood remains vitae, not human blood. Use of this ability — which creates a mockery of human life — mayinterfere with a character’s Path advancement, at theStoryteller’s discretion.The vampire is no more vulnerable to fire than anyother mortal while in this half-alive state, but she stillsuffers somewhat from the Beast. Frenzy and Rötschreckdifficulties are halved (round up). She can remain active during the day without Humanity or Path-baseddice pool caps, although she is certainly tired duringthe day, since that is not her usual time of activity.Her Beast exacts a dangerous retribution when herday of “life” is done. Although its influence is grea
tlysuppressed during this power’s duration, the Beast hasits way with the vampire for the next six nights, as alldifficulties to resist frenzy increase by three. The wisenecromancer hides herself away somewhere duringthat period, but, depending on morality and temperament, enforced isolation might drive her to frenzy onits own.



--The Grave’s Decay

	*This path is derived from the observation of theworking of time on all things mortal. Stone crumblesand the corpse rots away to nothing, a process of endless fascination to the lost Cainites known as Cappadocians. Indeed, for the undying, the process of decayis a fascinating disease that afflicts everyone and everything save them. Under this path, a practitioner ofNecromancy channels that force.

	1:Destroy the Husk

	*Cainites who kill their victims, rather than just feeding upon them, frequently find themselves in need of aquick way to dispose of a corpse. While there are manyways to make sure that a corpse is not found — feed itto a pack of hounds or weigh it down and throw it in ariver — many of these methods do involve risk to thevampire and are not guaranteed to succeed. Destroythe Husk, by contrast, is foolproof. Use of this powersimply turns one human corpse to a pile of about 30pounds (13 kilograms) of unremarkable dust, roughlythe size and shape of that body.System: The player spends one blood point as thevampire drips her vitae onto the corpse. The playerthen rolls Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 6). Onesuccess is all that is needed to render the corpse intodust, although the process takes a number of turnsequal to five minus the successes.

	2:Rigor Mortis

	*One of the first changes that comes over a dead bodyis rigidity; the corpse becomes stiff as a board, frozenin a single pose. The Cainite who wields Rigor Mortisis able to push a living or undead body to that frozenpoint using only his will and understanding of the forces of decay. She forces her target to become rigid andunable to move without enormous effort of will, as hisvery muscles betray him.System: The player spends a point of Willpower androlls Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 7). Each success freezes the target in place for one turn. A failuresimply indicates the loss of the Willpower point, whilea botch renders the target immune to powers in theGrave’s Decay path for the next 24 hours. The targetmust be visible and within about 25 yards or meters forthis ability to take effect. A frozen target is treated asthough he has been staked (see p. 280). With a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) and two successes, the targetcan break out of the rigor on her turn. Failure causesher
 a level of bashing damage and means another turnwasted and frozen.

	3:Wither

	*Reminiscent of some of the powers of Vicissitude,Wither allows a vampire to cripple an opponent’s limb.Whether the foe is living or undead, muscle shrivelsaway, skin peels, and bone becomes brittle. The target is unable to exert any noteworthy strength in thecrippled limb. This injury lasts for far longer than mostinjuries trouble vampires, and in mortals it simply doesnot heal.Wither doesn’t have to be used on a limb, althoughthat is its usual purpose. It can also be used simply toaffect the target’s face and hair, making him appear farolder than his years. It could also be applied to a target’s eye or ear, killing the sense in that organ (andthus requiring two uses to permanently blind or deafen). Wither cannot be used as an “instant-kill” power— necromancers cannot wither internal organs — butit can inflict a wide variety of injuries on a foe.System: The player spends a Willpower point. Thecharacter chooses a limb on the target and then touches that limb. If the t
arget is trying to avoid contact, theinvoker’s player rolls Dexterity + Brawl to hit as normal. If the character succeeds in touching the intendedlimb, the target suffers two aggravated wounds. Unlessthe target soaks both wounds (such as with Fortitude),the struck limb is crippled and unusable until both ofthose wounds have healed. Kindred heal the wounds as they would any other aggravated wound (see p. 285).Mortals are incapable of healing aggravated wounds, sothey suffer throughout their lives unless they are healedthrough supernatural means. A withered limb does notdegenerate further, even on a mortal. The charactermay be crippled for life, but the limb won’t becomeinfected or gangrenous.The effects of the withering depend on the affectedlimb. A crippled arm has a Strength of 0, cannot benefit from Potence, and cannot carry anything heavierthan about half a pound (200 grams). A crippled legprevents the character from moving faster than a stuttering hop or dragging limp. The cha
racter suffers theeffects of the Lame Flaw (see p. 482). A single witheredeye or ear imposes a +1 difficulty to relevant Perceptionrolls. Losing both eyes or both ears imposes the effectsof the Blind or Deaf Flaws (see pp. 484 and 483). Awithered tongue imposes the effects of the Mute Flaw(p. 483), while a withered face reduces the target’s Appearance by one for each aggravated wound suffered.

	4:Corrupt the Undead Flesh

	*Corrupt the Undead Flesh blurs the line between lifeand undeath, turning an undead creature into something just living enough to carry and suffer from disease. The disease inflicts the target, causing lethargy,dizziness, loss of strength, clumsiness, and the inability to keep blood in his system. This pernicious influence is extremely virulent among mortals. They pickthe disease up simply by spending a few hours near thevictim. Other vampires have a harder time acquiringthe disease. They must consume the victim’s blood todo so, but afterward, they suffer just as much as theoriginal target — including passing the affliction onto others.The disease fades after roughly a week.

	**System: The player chooses a target within hercharacter’s line of sight and no more than 20 yards ormeters away. She rolls Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 6) and spends a point of Willpower. The victim’splayer must roll Stamina (+ Fortitude, if appropriate)against a difficulty equal to the attacker’s Willpower. Ifthe player scores more successes than the victim, he acquires a virulent disease immediately. The disease hasthe following effects:

		@5 successes		The victim’s player must spend one additionalblood point every evening for the vampire to rousehimself to consciousness. Mortals lose one health levelper day instead.

		@6 successes		The victim’s player must roll Self-Control or Instinct each time the character feeds (difficulty 8). Ona failure, the vampire cannot keep the blood he justingested inside his body, and he vomits it up in greathorrifying gouts of gore, losing any benefit the bloodmight have provided. Humans vomit up food.Every evening at sunset, the victim has a chance tothrow off the plague. The victim’s player rolls Stamina,with a difficulty equal to 10 minus the number of sunsets since acquiring the plague. On a successful roll, thecharacter fights the disease to a standstill and beginsto recover. He instantly regains his ability to manageblood, and he heals back one lost Attribute point perhour until all have returned.

		@7 successes		The victim loses one point of Dexterity.

		@8 successes		The victim’s Strength and Wits are halved (rounddown).

		@9 successes		Dissolve the Flesh

	*This ability brings the Grave’s Decay path full circle,as it causes Destroy the Husk to apply to vampires. Dissolve the Flesh allows a necromancer to attempt toturn vampiric flesh to dust or ash, as though the targethad been burned or left out in the sun.System: The player spends two blood points and aWillpower point as the vampire extracts a quantity ofher vitae charged with the power of the grave. If shedrips it onto a single Kindred victim anytime withinthe next few turns (most of the blood must reach thevictim, so flinging a few drops is ineffective), it causeswhole chunks of the victim’s body to crumble to ash.The player rolls Willpower against a difficulty of thevictim’s Stamina + 3. For every success, the targettakes one aggravated wound.

	**The undead flesh damaged by this power turns todust (gone for the time being), and it must be regenerated painstakingly by the victim, should he survive.That dust doubtlessly has mystical properties that various sorcerers might be able to take advantage of. Everywound inflicted by this ability represents the loss ofabout one-eighth of the target’s weight; the Storytellerchooses where the loss comes from. (It might also beshed from all over, leaving the victim a bit gaunter ormissing chunks of flesh.) Regenerating body parts occurs naturally while healing aggravated wounds at the normal rate (see p. 285).



--Path of the Four Humors

	*Philosophically, the four humors represent differentqualities, split along two axes: hot and cold, and wetand dry. Blood is hot and wet; phlegm is cold and wet;yellow bile is hot and dry; and black bile is cold and dry.Historically, when a mortal was out of sorts or ill, it wassaid that his humors were out of balance, and a philosopher or physician would try to heal him by bringing hishumors back into balance. Ancient necromancers believed that in their undead forms, all four humors wereheld in a mystical stasis, and that they could tap into allfour of them instead of merely tapping into blood in theform of vitae as other vampires did.This antiquated path was primarily considered theknowledge of the Lamia bloodline, and certainly veryfew necromancers have learned this path without tutoring from a Lamia. Since the loss of the Lamia, eldernecromancers have searched everywhere (both in thisworld and the next) for clues to its existence.

	1:Whispers to the Soul

	*The necromancer with this ability can let slip a littleof her own undead bilious humor as she speaks to another being (whether mortal or Kindred). The wickedvapor slips into the target’s ear and whispers nightmares to the target throughout the day and night. Thetarget has a harder time sleeping, and becomes irritableand distracted during his waking hours.System: The character must whisper the target’sname (as she knows it) into his ear. The victim rollsWillpower (difficulty 8). If the roll fails, the victim suffers from nightmares and hears mad, wicked mutterings while awake, for a number of full days equal to thenecromancer’s Manipulation. The victim loses one diefrom all dice pools while thus afflicted, and at the Storyteller’s discretion, the difficulty to resist Rötschreckmay be increased by one at the same time.

	2:Kiss of the Dark Mother

	*Kiss of the Dark Mother allows the necromancerwho uses it to mix her vitae with black bile, turning itinto a noxious poison. The necromancer forces it intoher mouth as saliva might once have come; the vitaetastes acrid and bitter, as though it had been scorched.Once the necromancer coats her teeth and lips with it,she can inflict terrible damage with her bite.System: The player spends one blood point; activating this power is a reflexive action, but it must be donebefore making a bite attack. If the bite hits, the aggravated damage inflicted by a single bite is doubled be- fore soak is calculated. This power does not affect thecharacter’s ability to drain blood from the target, nordoes it increase the amount of damage done by bloodloss. The necromancer’s bite remains potent until thisability is discharged by a successful hit or she spendsone turn cleansing the dark blood from her mouth.

	3:Dark Humors

	*The vampire can exude a coat of a particular humoronto her skin, causing all that touch it to experiencethe most intense form of that humor. After a necromancer has used this power, she generally feels theopposite of the sensation the humor usually conveys:Using blood leaves her depressed and pessimistic; usingyellow bile renders her calm and placid; using blackbile leaves her optimistic; and using phlegm makes heraroused and angry.System: The player spends two blood points. Thenecromancer chooses which humor she wishes to excrete. The humor can simply coat the skin — in whichcase touching the victim’s skin lets the humor take effect — or it can act as a poison if placed in a beverage (or in vitae). The victim must make a Stamina roll(difficulty 8) to resist the effects of the humor:• Phlegm: Target becomes lethargic; all dice poolsare reduced by two for the remainder of the scene.• Blood (vitae): Target becomes prone to excessivebleeding, and any lethal or aggravated woun
ds he suffers deal an additional health level of damage on theturn after they originally occur. Vitae altered by DarkHumors will not turn a human into a ghoul if ingested,nor will it initiate a blood bond.• Black Bile: Target suffers a number of health levelsof damage equal to the necromancer’s Stamina. Thisdamage is considered lethal and can be soaked (if thevictim is normally capable of soaking such damage),though armor does not protect against it.• Yellow Bile: Target becomes melancholic and isplagued with visions of death. He cannot spend Willpower for the remainder of the scene, and all Willpower rolls receive a +2 difficulty.

	4:Clutching the Shroud

	*Blood, the sanguine humor, was regarded by philosophers as being both hot and wet. Blood from a coldcorpse has been transubstantiated into a dead form —a cold incarnation of a hot, wet element. This transformation of the living into death holds great power;the necromancer knows how to infuse her own beingwith the blood of a cold corpse and transform herself into something not wholly vampiric. Instead, the necromancer edges closer to being an animated corpse infact as well as name. She grows distant and chill, asthough possessed by the spirit of Death itself; she has towork to push her attention into the physical world.System: The character must drink, and then spend,five blood points from a cold corpse (one dead for 24hours or more, but generally less than three days). Itwill generally take at least two turns to consume thatblood, and the power is not activated until the character can spend all of it. For example, if the characteris Twelfth Generation, Clutching the Shroud takes a
tleast seven turns total to activate (two to consume theblood and five to spend it).After the power is active and for the rest of the scene,the necromancer gains several benefits. First, she receives two additional soak dice, which may be used tosoak any sort of damage, even if the character does notpossess Fortitude. Second, she gains a mystic sense ofhow far those in the area are from death — whetherthey are healthy or infirm, suffer from diseases, or areundead, ghouls, or mortals. Finally, a Manipulation +Occult roll lets her speak with ghosts freely. The difficulty for this roll depends on how attuned to death alocale is; a cemetery would be difficulty 5, while a cozyapartment might be difficulty 7. However, this abilitymakes the necromancer much more susceptible to theeffects of powers used by ghosts, which means that shemust act carefully.

	5:Black Breath

	*A necromancer who has mastered this path can harness the undead black bile that festers at the core of herbeing; she pulls that melancholy to her lungs and lets itmingle with her outgoing breath. She then exhales thedark mist, letting it engulf those nearby. The necromancer feels curiously lightheaded and optimistic afterusing this power, as she has forced some of her mostdepressed nature out into the world; those caught inthe black vapors grow despairing and hopeless.System: The player spends one Willpower and oneblood point, and rolls Stamina + Athletics (difficulty7). Black Breath allows the character to exhale a darkcloud of vapor that is five yards or meters in diameter persuccess rolled. Those caught in the mists may attempta Dexterity + Athletics roll to escape it if they have anavailable action; otherwise, they may be overwhelmedby depression to the point of suicide. Those who cannot escape the mists must immediately roll Willpower (difficulty 8 for mortals, 7 for supernatur
al beings) andachieve more successes than the invoker did. Mortalswho fail in this actively attempt to kill themselves ontheir next turn. They do not attempt such ludicroussuicides as praying for a lightning bolt or holding theirbreath; they use the most effective means at hand toend their own lives. If prevented from suicide, they attempt it again as soon as an opportunity presents itself.This impulse lasts for the rest of the scene, and the Storyteller may impose flare-ups over the next day or so athis discretion. Those who succeed on the Willpowerroll still become enchanted with the prospect of death,whether mortal or Kindred, and lose two dice from alldice pools for the rest of the scene.Kindred who fail the Willpower roll do not attemptsuicide; as they are already dead, the malign influencesof undead humors do not have as strong an effect onthem. Instead, the affected vampire sinks into torpor.The duration of this torpor is based on the vampire’sHumanity or Path rating, just as
 if lethal wounds hadforced him into it.



--Vitreous Path

	*The Vitreous Path allows a necromancer to controland influence the energies pertaining to death. Thisextremely rare path manipulates entropy, a force thateven most necromancers are uncomfortable harnessing. A development of the Nagaraja bloodline (p. 406,although they sometimes call the path “Nihilistics”),the Vitreous Path makes a formidable complement tothe necromantic craft, and those obsessed with mastery over death and souls — such as the Harbingers ofSkulls — would certainly risk much to uncover thispath’s secrets.Like most necromancers, Nagaraja generally learnthe Sepulchre Path before any others. The VitreousPath is usually their second focus of study.

	1:Eyes of the Dead

	*The necromancer employing the Eyes of the Deadcan see with the perceptions of the Restless Dead(called Deathsight). To such a manipulator of ghostlyenergies, the auras of surrounding beings give off telltale hints as to their health and even their ultimatefate; the necromancer can see the energies of deathflowing through everyone, just as ghosts can. By looking at the entropic markings on a person’s body, thenecromancer can gain rough knowledge of how far thatperson is from death, how soon that person is likely todie, and even what the cause of her death is likely to be. The information thus gained is not exact by anymeans, but it gives the necromancer an edge over thoseshe scrutinizes.

	**System: The player rolls Perception + Occult, difficulty 6. One success lets a necromancer determinewhether someone is injured, diseased, or dying, as wellas whether the individual labors under any sort of curseor baleful magic.Further, the vampire can divine the target’s eventualdemise, depending on the successes scored. One success means the character can guess how long the target has to live to within a few weeks. Three successesmeans the character can estimate how long the targethas to live and what the probable source of death willbe, as the entropic markings show the wounds that willsomeday exist on that person. Five successes means thecharacter can actually see where and when the eventwill occur by interpreting the black marks on the target’s soul.This ability lasts for one scene, though the necromancer may choose to end the power early. It can beused to read the fate of only one target at a time. Storytellers should exercise judgment with this power, sincethe markings o
f death are typically unavoidable. Hemay decide to roll the dice himself, so that the playerhas no way of knowing whether her insight is correct.

	2:Aura of Decay

	*The necromancer can strengthen the feeling of entropy around her to the point where it breaks downnonliving objects and machines. It can gnarl wood,rust metal, crack silicon chips, and erode plastic, glass,and dead organic material. This power has a range ofone yard or meter from the necromancer’s body, but allthose in the presence of the vampire can feel her corruption as an icy wind.System: No roll is required, but this power does costat least one blood point. Objects subjected to this Auraof Decay break down and become useless after beingtargeted. How the object gives out, as well as the exactmechanism of failure, is up to the Storyteller. Corrosion, metal fatigue, or sheer brittleness are all suitablylikely for any given item’s demise, but the in-game effect of using a doomed item is as if the owning character rolled a botch. The speed at which an item breaksdown depends on how many blood points are spent.

	**Blood Spent 		Time to Breakdown

	**One			One week

	**Two			One day

	**Three			End of scene

	**Four			Five turns

	**Five			One turn

	**Note that since this power requires the expenditureof blood points, a character cannot cause an Aura ofDecay while staked.

	3:Soul Feast

	*Just as the necromancer can release entropic energies from within, she may also pull them into herselfas a source of power. Soul Feasting allows the casterto either draw on the ambient death energies aroundher or to actively feed on a ghost, stealing the wraith’ssubstance and mystically transforming that energy intosustenance.System: The player spends one Willpower point toallow the vampire to feed on the negative energies ofthe dead. If the character is drawing the energies fromthe atmosphere, she must be in a place where death hasoccurred within the hour or in a place where death iscommon, such as a cemetery, a morgue, or the scene ofa recent murder. Generally, the necromancer can drawanywhere from one to four points of entropy from sucha location, although the difficulty in using all Necromancy and similar deathly powers within the areaincreases by an equal amount for a number of nightsequal to the points taken. The energies of such an areamay only be drained once until the are
a’s entropy replenishes.In cases when the necromancer feeds on a ghost, thevampire must actually attack the wraith as if feedingnormally. Wraiths have up to 10 “blood points” thatmay be taken from them, and they become less andless substantial as their spirit essence drains away. Thecharacter is vulnerable to any attack the ghost mightmake, even those that do not normally affect the physical world; while feeding, the vampire is essentially ina half-state, existing in both the living lands and theUnderworld simultaneously. The wraith so attacked isconsidered immobilized and cannot run or escape unless it can defeat the vampire in a resisted Willpowerroll (difficulty 6 for both sides). This power may alsobe used in conjunction with Ash Path Necromancy,allowing the vampire to drain power (though not sustenance) from ghosts while traveling in the lands ofthe dead.This soul energy may be used just like blood in every respect except for when the vampire rises for the night. It can act
ivate Disciplines, heal wounds, boostAttributes, etc. Botching this power renders the vampire unable to feed through the Shroud for the rest ofthe night. However, she remains susceptible to the assaults of ghosts and spirits for several turns (generally,a number of turns equal to the amount of energy thatcould have been drawn from the area, or one turn if attacking a ghost) as she hovers between worlds, unableto function effectively in either.

	4:Breath of Thanatos

	*The Breath of Thanatos allows the necromancer todraw out entropic energy and focus it upon an areaor person by taking a deep breath and then forcefullyexhaling a fog of necromantic energy. This cloud ofvirulence is completely invisible to anyone without theability to see the passing of entropy. The energy of thiscloud is like a beacon for Spectres, and they are drawnto the entropic force like moths to a flame.Once the energy is pulled from the necromancer’sbody, she can either disperse it over a large area as alure for Spectres, or use the mist for more sinister purposes. Channeled into an object or person, the deathmist inflicts the subject with a debilitating, wasting illness. Furthermore, the focused energies are tainted andeerie, and though generally invisible (except to powerssuch as Aura Perception), they tend to cause peopleand animals to feel uncomfortable around the victim.System: The player spends one blood point and rollsWillpower (difficulty 8). Only one success is nee
ded todraw out the Breath of Thanatos. If dispersed to summon Spectres, the energies cover roughly one-quarterof a mile (400 meters) in radius, centered around thenecromancer. The range increases by an additionalone-quarter mile or 400 meters for every additionalblood point expended.Spectres summoned with this power will ignore thesummoning necromancer for the duration of the power unless provoked, but may well go out of their wayto wreak havoc on anyone else in the vicinity. Thenecromancer can then use other Necromancy powers(such as those in the Sepulchre Path) to manipulateand affect these Spectres. Ghosts so targeted may theninteract with the necromancer as normal, although theother Spectres in the area will continue to ignore boththe vampire and the targeted ghost. This energy disperses after a scene, after which the Spectres leave tofind new prey. Mechanics for Spectres can be found onp. 385.

	**If the cloud is directed toward a particular target, thenecromancer must either touch the target or direct thestream of entropy using Dexterity + Occult (difficulty7). A target laden with entropy suffers one (and onlyone) level of aggravated damage; this generally manifests as sudden illness or decay. The target’s social difficulties while interacting with those unfamiliar withthe touch of death — most normal humans, as well assome supernatural creatures — increase by 2. Furthermore, supernatural perceptions indicate the target istainted with decay, which can be dangerous. This formof taint lasts until sunrise; a victim already plagued bythis power cannot be affected again until the previousfog of entropy has dispersed.A botch on the roll to control this power indicatesthat the vampire has turned the energy upon himself,and suffers all the effects of the vitriolic breath. Thisinflicts the usual injury and may subject the necromancer to the possibly dangerous attention of prov
okedSpectres and other creatures from beyond the grave.

	5:Night Cry

	*The breath of entropic energy becomes a scream ofpure chaos. The necromancer can issue an unearthly cry(heard both in the living world and in the Shadowlands).The howl pours icy oblivion into a target or group oftargets — either sweeping away the inherent entropy orcollecting that destruction and unleashing it.System: The vampire chooses a number of targetswithin one yard or meter per dot of Necromancy andinvokes Night Cry with a terrible scream. The playerspends a Willpower point and a blood point for eachtarget beyond the first. (In other words, she spendsno blood if only going after one target, or one bloodfor two targets. Generational blood limits apply, andthe vampire may not “pre-spend” blood prior to usingNight Cry.)The player then chooses whether the vampire will aidor harm the targets, and rolls Manipulation + Occult(difficulty 6). If she chooses to aid the target or targets,each success gives each affected target a -2 difficultymodifier to all of his actions for one 
turn per success. Ifshe instead chooses harm, each success causes an aggravated wound to each target. Targets may be any kind ofliving creature, including supernatural ones.No matter the result, the Night Cry is heard on bothsides of the Shroud, attracting the attention of anyonenearby. On a botch, the necromancy may summon unruly ghosts or Spectres, similar to Breath of Thanatos (although the ghosts are under no compulsion to ignore the necromancer…).



----Assamite Sorcery

	*From a purely functional standpoint, the blood magicthat the Assamite sorcerer caste practices differs littlefrom that wielded by the Tremere. From a philosophical perspective, however, worlds of difference separatethe two. The Tremere force every piece of knowledgethey incorporate into the structured, rigid frameworkof high Hermetic invocation. By contrast, the sorcerercaste’s practices are the result of millennia of adaptation and melding, and are too disparate to be considered “structured” in any real sense. The modern bodyof knowledge that is Assamite Sorcery draws its content from a wide array of magical traditions, from theecstatic rites of Kali and Shiva’s followers to the subtle precision of feng shui to the elegant symbolic andmathematical transformations of Islamic alchemistsand astronomers.Assamite Sorcery is mechanically identical to themore common Thaumaturgy that appears on pp. 212240. However, though they work on similar principles(the use of vampiric vitae to
 fuel exertions of consciouswill in order to effect change upon the physical orspiritual world), the two are not cross-compatible. ATremere strives to perform his magic the same way, allthe time, every time. An Assamite might never enactthe same ritual the same exact way twice in a millennium.As may be expected, students of Assamite Sorceryhave great difficulty learning the practices of otherblood magic traditions. All experience points costs tolearn other blood magic paths and rituals are increasedby half (round up) for Assamite sorcerers. In addition,even once the sorcerer has incorporated these lessonsinto her repertoire, they are still alien to her. All invocations of a “foreign” path require one extra bloodpoint and all rituals take triple the normal time andrequire one extra success for any desired result.Awakening of the SteelAlthough combat mastery is hardly the sorcerercaste’s primary goal, they have a long tradition ofstanding ready to defend themselves and, if need be
, assisting the warrior caste on the battlefield. Awakening of the Steel is one legacy of this preparedness,a path that some say began with the alchemists whostudied in the forges of Toledo and Damascus. This setof techniques focuses on the symbolism of the swordas the ultimate extension of a trained warrior’s body,drawing on the myths that various warrior traditionsattached to their swords and daggers: European Crusaders and their blessed blades, the kris of IndonesianPentjak-Silat practitioners, and Indian Ghurkas andtheir kukri knives, among others. The practitioner ofAwakening of the Steel focuses on this symbolism ashe uses the power of his blood to enhance his weaponand his skill. A student of Awakening of the Steel finds that akeen understanding of both the form and the functionof a blade is necessary for full mastery of this path. Acharacter must have a level of either Melee or CraftsAbility equal to his level in Awakening of the Steel.Those who practice this path also find 
that its lessonsare tightly focused, perhaps to the point of overspecialization. The path is at its most effective with swordsand knives, and the wielder can only extend its effectsto other edged weapons. Any attempt to use a technique of this path on another edged weapon is at +1difficulty.

	1:Confer with the Blade

	*Although few Assamites claim to have actually spoken to a weapon’s soul, blacksmiths and warriors alikehave ascribed spiritual qualities to hand-forged bladesfor centuries. Practitioners of Auspex are familiar withthe manner in which inanimate objects can bear impressions of their own history. Confer with the Bladeallows a weapon’s wielder to delve into the events thathave occurred around his weapon. Some practitionersof this power claim this makes the weapon feel more“comfortable” in their hands, while others speak of thesense of history that an ancient blade bears. The actualimpressions only take an instant to gain, though manyprefer to spend much longer in contemplation if timepermits.System: The number of successes determines theamount of information the sorcerer gains regarding theblade’s history and its present state, as well as all information yielded by a lesser number of successes. Withthree or more successes, the sorcerer may lower thedifficulty on his next attem
pt to apply a blood-magicritual to the weapon by one.

	2:Grasp of the Mountain

	*The best scimitar in all creation does its owner nogood if it’s lying five yards away from him. Grasp ofthe Mountain strengthens the spiritual bond betweenthe sword and the swordsman in order to reinforce thewielder’s physical grip on his weapon. A blade thatis under the effect of this art never leaves its master’shand unless he so wills it.System: For the rest of the scene, the character hasa number of automatic successes to resist all attemptsto disarm him, equal to the number of successes rolled.He cannot accidentally drop the blade (which meanshis botches are likely to result in self-mutilation instead of an empty hand). If the character is somehowdisarmed in spite of Grasp of the Mountain, he maycall the blade back to his hand by successfully invokingthis power again, assuming he has a clear line of sightto the weapon.

	3:Pierce Steel’s Skin

	*At this level of understanding, the sorcerer can command his blade with such precision that he can strikeat an opponent’s physical protection rather than hisbody. The sword transfers its full fury to the intendedtarget, shredding even the toughest chain or plate. Thisstrips away the victim’s defenses, leaving him vulner- able to the next attack. While this power is of limitedutility in modern nights, as traditional armor has fallenby the wayside, it remains in the path’s progression oflessons due to its utility in destroying other obstacles.System: While Pierce Steel’s Skin is in effect, an attack against an unarmored target inflicts half damage(rounded down). However, for a number of turns equalto the number of successes rolled, each successful attack the character makes against an armored foe inflicts damage on the target’s body armor rather than injuring him directly. Only metal armor can be damagedby this power. When the character makes a successfulattack against an ar
mored target, the player does notroll damage. Instead, he rolls a number of dice equalto the sword’s damage bonus (the number of dice thatit adds to his Strength) against a difficulty of 7. Eachsuccess reduces the armor’s soak bonus by one die. Armor that is reduced to zero soak dice in this manneris completely destroyed and unsalvageable. Additionalsuccesses beyond those needed to destroy a piece of armor have no effect.At the Storyteller’s discretion, Pierce Steel’s Skinmay destroy other inanimate objects (walls, doors, cars,dramatically appropriate obstacles) without significantdamage to the sword. For the purposes of this power,Fortitude counts as part of the target’s Stamina, notexternal armor.

	4:Razor’s Shield

	*Many swordsmen hold that the duel is the ultimatetest of the warrior because it places all opponents on anequal footing: Death is only three feet of steel away, andonly the skill of the combatants determines who walksaway. However, observers who are more pragmatic thanromantic note that an enemy with a ranged weapon(be it bow, sling, or gun) has the advantage of striking from much farther away than arm’s length. WhileAwakening of the Steel cannot completely counteractthis advantage, this power allows the skilled sorcerersome measure of defense as the sword interposes itselfbetween its master and attacks from afar.System: For a number of turns equal to the numberof successes rolled, the character may attempt to parryprojectiles. This requires one action for each projectilethat the player wishes to block, and the character mustbe able to see the shot coming (Heightened Senses allows visual tracking of bullets). Each parrying attemptrequires a Dexterity + Melee roll, with a difficult
y determined by the speed of the projectile. Thrown objects have a difficulty of 6, arrows and crossbow bolts a difficulty of 7, and bullets a difficulty of 9. Each successsubtracts one success from the attacker’s attack roll.Razor’s Shield does not allow the character to parryranged attacks that do not incorporate solid projectiles,such as flame, lightning, or spat blood.

	5:Strike at the True Flesh

	*Although pacifists may find other uses for blades, awarrior knows that swords were created for one purpose: to carve an enemy’s flesh into bloody ruin. Strikeat the True Flesh invokes the very essence of the sorcerer’s weapon, reducing it to the embodiment of itsvery definition (or, as the more classically mindedwould put it, invoking the Platonic form) while simplifying its target to a similarly basic level. The resultsof such an invocation are usually devastating on both aphilosophical and practical level as weapon and victimmomentarily lose all supernatural attributes.System: The effects of Strike at the True Flesh lastfor a number of turns equal to the number of successesrolled, and they end with the first successful attack thatthe character makes within this time period. The swordinflicts only the base amount of lethal damage that aweapon of its size and type would normally cause, disregarding all enhancements that it may have received(though augmentations to the wielder’
s strength orspeed, such as Potence and Celerity, still have their normal effects, as do extra successes on the attack roll).However, all the target’s supernatural defenses (including Fortitude) are likewise negated — he soaks theattack only with his base Stamina. If the negation ofhis powers and defenses renders the target unable tosoak lethal damage, he cannot soak the attack at all.Body armor does protect against this attack, as it is amundane form of defense.



----Koldunic Sorcery

	*The actual casting of Koldunic sorcery requires morethan a clumsy exertion of will. Such magic demandsperfection of form and mastery of the appropriate lore.The caster’s player spends one blood point and rolls(Attribute) + Occult against a difficulty of the power’slevel + 3, with the specific Attribute listed for eachpath or “way.” Vampires always use the base Attribute,ignoring any bonuses gained from blood expenditureor other Disciplines. All kolduns must select one of theways listed below as their primary path.The Way of EarthCapable of great destruction and great healing, theearth is the womb of life and the sepulcher of death. Itdrinks all blood violently spilled upon its soil, and somirrors the vampire. It is by association with the earthas a source of strength that a koldun enacts his will.



--The Way of Earth

	1:Grasping Soil

	*A koldun invoking this power may command earthto rise in a spray of dirt and crawl up a victim’s legs.This power can only command soil, not stone, and mayonly target victims standing on the earth.System: The koldun may direct any patch of earthwithin a 100-foot/30-meter radius to ensnare a targetfor two turns per success rolled. Animated dirt ascendsand constricts midway between the victim’s knees andhips, holding her fast unless her player scores five successes on Strength + Survival roll (difficulty 6). It isalso possible to use this power as an attack, in whichcase the grasping earth crushes once and then releases.Used in this manner, each success on the casting inflicts one level of lethal damage. Such damage manifests as broken legs and crushed feet.

	2:Endurance of Stone

	*Drawing the essence of earth into himself, a koldunmay gain a measure of its preternatural resilience. Under the effects of this power, a vampire’s skin resemblesa horrid fusion of flesh and stone that cracks and flowsimpossibly with every movement.System: A successful activation roll grants the koldun two extra dots of Stamina for the rest of the scene.These dots are considered part of the character’s natural Stamina and may aid in any uses of that Attribute,including soak.

	3:Hungry Earth

	*Expanding on the power of Grasping Soil, a koldunmay use this power to drag a victim into the earth.He need only gesture and the soil beneath his victimopens like the maw of a great beast. This power mayensnare any victim who stands upon the earth within100 feet/30 meters of the koldun.System: Like Grasping Soil, every success on the activation roll leaves the victim immobile for one turn.However, the difficulty of the Strength + Survival rollto break free increases to 8 and doing so still requiresfive successes. As the earth continues to shift and graspwhile the power remains active, this roll must be madeas a single (though repeatable) attempt rather than anextended test. In addition, beings trapped in the crushing pit suffer one level of lethal damage each turn. Beings capable of soaking this damage may do so, but atdifficulty 7. At the end of the power’s duration, theearth yawns once more to release the victim. Attribute: Stamina

	4:Root of Vitality

	*As with Hungry Earth, the koldun may direct theland to bury any target standing on the earth withina 100-foot/30-meter radius. Yet this power is far morebenevolent in its intent, if no less disturbing in itsmanifestation. The soil ripples, parting and closing likesome obscene womb as it draws the target a full yardbeneath the surface. Living beings entombed in thisfashion do not suffocate, as the enchanted soil pumpsair from above in undulating breaths. Better still, thefertile essence of the earth presses upon her flesh andrestores it to new health. Still, the process is highlydisturbing and unnatural, especially as targets remainwholly aware in silent, helpless immobility for the fullduration. It is possible for a koldun to heal himself withthis power.System: The player spends as many blood points asdesired (which may require multiple turns dependingon Generation) and makes the activation roll. Eachsuccess permits the earth to heal two levels of bashing damage or one level of leth
al damage. Healing aggravated damage requires two successes per level. Thetotal number of health levels that may be restored witheach use of this power is the number of blood pointsinvested or the number of successes on the activationroll, whichever is lower. Any blood points spent beyond the number of successes drain away to no effect.The actual healing process takes one turn per bashinglevel, one minute per lethal level, and one hour peraggravated level. Once the healing is complete or thepower is interrupted through determined excavation,the earth expels the target back to the surface.

	5:Kupala’s Fury

	*Mortals pray in fear when the mountains shake.They fear the wrath of the Old Gods, and rightfully so.This is not a power used lightly or capriciously, becauseit represents one of the greatest weapons available toKoldunic Sorcery.System: This power requires a Willpower point inaddition to the usual cost and activation roll. The koldun smites the earth with his fist, and his anger flowsthrough the soil to any target in his line of sight. Thequake erupts outward from that point, inflicting 10dice of lethal damage on everything and everyone inthe area of effect. Most wooden structures collapseentirely and even buildings of concrete and steel maygrow cracked and pitted with superficial damage fromthe shaking earth. This tremor lasts one turn and affects an area determined by the number of successes rolled. It is not possible to apply fewer successes thanthose rolled.

		@1 success		One house or single storefront

		@2 successes		Five lesser structures or a small cityblock

		@3 successes		An entire side street or a largecity block

		@4 successes		Multiple square blocks or a largestructure (like a stadium)

		@5 successes		An entire neighborhood or massiveindustrial complex

		

--The Way of Wind

	*Subtler than mastery over earth, this way evokes theair in the breath of the living and last rattle of a dyingman. In stillness or motion, koldun turn all aspects ofair to their unliving design.Attribute: Perception

	1:Breath of Whispers

	*Even in their absence, koldun instill deep fear intheir servants. This power carries the vampire’s wordson a light breeze and returns with the target’s reply.The vampire need only address the target by name andforcibly mimic a deep exhalation of breath as he speakshis message.System: Every time the koldun wishes to send anew message via this power, his player makes the usualactivation roll. However, the player need only spendblood the first time the power is used during a givenscene. Each success permits one turn of speech. Afterthe vampire concludes the message, swift winds carryit to its destination. Within a minute, the target hearsthe koldun as if the vampire whispered in his ear. Hemay reply or remain silent, but anything he says withina number of turns equal to the koldun’s successes fliesback to the koldun. This power may bring words toanyone within a mile (one and a half kilometers) whois not in a sealed room. While using this power, a koldun must concentrate fully. An
y disturbance breaksthe communication.

	2:Biting Gale

	*Vengeful koldun sought to invoke a wind as chillas air atop the Carpathian Mountains. This powerachieves that end, unleashing a cutting wind that canfreeze a man’s blood in his veins as it swirls through an area of his choosing. Besides its obvious combat applications, this power also facilitates a dramatic entrancefor those so inclined. System: With a successful activation roll, the koldun summons a freezing wind within a maximum ofa 100-yard/meter radius. Anyone caught in this frigid blast suffers one die of bashing damage each turn(which may be soaked normally), loses two dice fromall Dexterity pools, and moves at half normal speed.The winds last as long as the koldun wills, provided hemaintains concentration. Any non-reflexive actionson the part of the vampire cause the winds to still anddissipate. This includes any movement.

	3:Breeze of Lethargy

	*Although they cannot induce immediate sleep, thewinds evoked by this power bring growing exhaustionand numbing weariness through every muscle. Victimsof this power often smell a hint of bittersweet smokebefore they fall entranced.System: For two turns per success, the koldun creates a wind inflicting extreme lethargy within a 200foot/60-meter radius. Players of characters caught inthis wind must roll Stamina + Survival (difficulty 8).This roll is made once every ten minutes of exposure.Failure means the character halves all dice pools involving physical actions for the remaining duration ofthe wind and halves all movement rates for the scene.A botch puts the character to sleep (or a state of lighttorpor for vampires) for the scene. Sleeping charactersawaken if prodded, shaken, or otherwise manhandled,though they move slowly and may suffer halved dicepools if the wind persists.

	4:Ride the Tempest

	*A koldun employing this power moves at incrediblespeeds as he rides along the winds. While travelingwith this power, a vampire assumes a blurred form thatcoalesces as he reaches his destination.System: With a successful activation roll, the koldunfades into the wind and flies at 250 mph/400 kph to hisdestination. This power cannot effectively function incaves, buildings, or other enclosed areas. Outside, thevampire’s flight navigates all obstacles. Once the koldun arrives at his destination or the scene ends, thevampire descends to earth and solidifies.

	5:Tempest

	*Applying fury magnified by blood and will, a koldunmay project the full measure of his anger into the nightsky. Churning gray clouds blot out stars and moon, unleashing spiraling gusts and a driving downpour offreezing rain. Lightning arcs overhead, with each thunderous flash casting jagged shadows. System: With a successful activation roll and a pointof Willpower (in addition to the usual blood), a koldunmay conjure a terrible storm. It takes six hours for theclouds to gather and thicken overhead, minus one hourfor every success rolled. If this results in a duration ofless than one hour, the clouds blossom outward fromdirectly overhead like a black canopy, filling the sky inmere minutes. Once the clouds form, the rain beginsto fall in torrents and the lightning begins. The stormpersists at full strength for one hour per success rolled. Itgradually dissipates over the hour following that. Duringthe peak of its fury, the storm may cause flooding andcertainly chills any exposed mortal
 to the bone (1 dieof unsoakable bashing damage every five minutes of fullexposure). Lightning strikes regularly, far more than ausual storm. Indeed, for a cost of one Willpower point,a koldun may direct lightning at a foe using his Perception + Occult (difficulty 6). A successful strike inflicts10 dice of lethal damage (which can be soaked normally). Only one such attack may be made each turn.



--The Way of Water

	*Largely practiced by koldun with havens near a largewater source, this way can raise watery spirit slaves anddash a ship to splinters. More subtly, the vampire maylurk in the depths or conjure illusions to confound anddazzle his foes.Attribute: Wits

	1:Pool of Lies

	*This versatile power creates three-dimensional illusions along the surface of a water source. How a koldunuses such illusions depends on his temperament andwill. It is just as easy to feign a divine visitation as acunning seduction.System: With a successful activation roll, the koldun may project an illusion on any water surface in lineof sight. The illusion may speak and move however thevampire wishes, though it has no substance and cannot step beyond the bounds of the water. The phantomlasts one turn per success rolled, after which it slowlydissipates into fine mist. It is possible to extend thislifespan with subsequent activations of the power, eachof which stack in determining final duration. Rolls toextend an illusion’s duration add one to the base difficulty, but require no blood. Once an illusion fadesaway, it must be cast anew.

	2:Watery Haven

	*Just as the Gangrel meld with the earth, so may akoldun with this power sink beneath the water to escape the sun. The vampire does not so much submergeas merge with the water. Though his slumbering formmay be visible at odd angles from above, only the mostdetermined splashing can disturb his rest.System: This power requires no blood. If the player gainstwo or more successes on the activation roll, the vampiresinks into the water as per the Protean power Earth Meld.A body of water must be at least two feet deep and as largein other dimensions as the vampire’s body to contain him.Catching a glimpse of a hidden koldun in the water requiresa successful Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 8).

	3::Fog Over Sea

	*Moving with the unnatural grace of a ghost, a koldunemploying this power may stride across water as readilyas land, leaving nary a ripple to mark his passing. Somevampires delight in using this power in conjunctionwith Pool of Lies to conjure phantasms to attend them.System: For every success on the activation roll, thekoldun may walk on water for one scene or one hour,whichever is longer. A koldun may choose to drop the effects of this power in order to submerge or swim;however, the vampire may not walk on water again unless he reactivates the power.

	4:Minions of the Deep

	*By dripping his blood into a body of water, a koldunmay summon or rouse embodied water elementals toserve him for a night. Such minions are infallibly loyal,if not especially clever. Despite their liquid form, theyare solid enough to grab a man and drag him to a watery grave or pummel him like the crashing surf.System: The player spends one Willpower point andmakes the standard activation roll. With success, theplayer may spend blood to summon elemental minions.This blood must be dripped or flung into a body of water, which may require multiple turns depending ongenerational limits for blood expenditure.Once the last drop of blood falls, the water rises intowhatever form the koldun desires. The caster may create as many minions as blood points spent, though notmore than the total number of successes rolled. Regardless of their form, the spirits have a rating equal tothe vampire’s Wits in all Traits. These beings have noKnowledges and no Skills apart from Stealth. Further- more, th
eir Mental and Social Attributes are consideredto have a rating of 1 except in passive or defensive situations (such as to resist persuasion or mind-control).Water elementals soak and otherwise suffer damage asvampires, including from sunlight. Fire harms them less,inflicting bashing damage only. Moreover, the waterycreatures may extinguish flames with their liquid bodies, though not without suffering injury. An elementalwho leaves the body of water that spawned it suffersone level of aggravated damage per hour. Minions regenerate one level of damage of any kind (includingaggravated) each turn they remain in contact with alarge body of water, but do not otherwise heal. Unlessdestroyed, summoned minions last until the next dawnbefore collapsing into inanimate puddles.

	5:Doom Tide

	*Many ships lie at the bottom of the Black Sea, shattered by the whirlpools of the koldun. Victims of thispower must fight with every ounce of their strength orfall into the whirling, airless depths below.System: The player spends a Willpower point in addition to the usual blood. For every success on the activation roll, the resulting whirlpool has a radius of fivefeet/1.5 meters, centered anywhere in the vampire’s lineof sight. Whirlpools have a base Strength of 15, increasing by 5 dots per success after the first. Victims must successfully oppose this Strength with their own Strength +Survival (difficulty 8) in order to break free. Those whofail are sucked into the depths and pounded with crushingcurrents. Living beings drown normally, while vampiresand other non-breathing creatures simply remain trappedhelplessly in the vortex. This power lasts for one scene.



--The Way of Fire

	*The ancient anathema of vampires, the element offire offers the most powerful and dangerous tool available to koldun. The Way of Fire shares aspects with theWay of Earth, in that it focuses more on magma andfiery rock than pure, naked flame.Attribute: Manipulation

	1:Fiery Courage

	*No vampire can master an element he fears, so this power dims that fear to a mere ember of its former intensity.System: Once learned, this power is permanent andrequires no activation roll or blood. The koldun subtracts his rating in the Way of Fire from the difficulty of Courage rolls to resist Rötschreck from exposure orproximity to flame. This power does not aid in resisting the panic that accompanies sunlight or any othercauses apart from actual fire. If this reduces the difficulty of a Courage roll below two, the koldun simplydoes not succumb to the Red Fear. Koldun never riskRötschrek from fire and magma they conjure.

	2:Combust

	*The Cainite’s eyes flash vivid orange with sorcerouspower as superheated air coils around the target. Inmoments, the target bursts into spontaneous flame.System: For every success on the activation roll, thetarget suffers one level of aggravated damage. This attack may be dodged, but not blocked, and can affectliving (or unliving) beings at +2 difficulty. It is onlypossible to make one fiery attack per turn.

	3:Wall of Magma

	*The koldun raises his hand and the earth splits,spraying a wall of glowing magma 10 feet/3 metershigh. Normally, this wall forms a 10-foot/3-meter radius circle around the vampire, although the sorcerercan raise other shapes with practice and skill.System: The wall of magma summoned with thispower has a lifespan of two turns per success rolled. Ifthe koldun wishes to release the magma along a shapeother than a protective circle, increase the base difficulty by one. Characters cannot approach a wall ofmolten rock without a Courage roll (difficulty 8), andeven then, the close blistering heat inflicts a level ofaggravated damage. Actual contact with the lava increases the damage to three levels and raises the soakdifficulty to 9, assuming any sort of soak is possible. Thekoldun takes no damage from his proximity to the summoned magma (although contact with it still damageshim as normal).

	4:Heat Wave

	*The koldun acts as a conduit for steam geysers andchannels a blast of desiccating air at a victim withinline of sight. This fiery wind appears as a rippling heatwave enveloping the victim. Individuals slain withthis gruesome power appear as withered, mummifiedhusks.System: On a successful activation roll, the victimsuffers five levels of lethal damage that may be soakedby beings capable of such. Vampire targets also lose fiveblood points, regardless of the damage inflicted.

	5:Volcanic Blast

	*At the final mastery of Way of Fire, a koldun commands lava to explode from the ground in a huge geyser. The molten rock spews across a wide swath beforecrashing to earth and flowing in all directions. Anything in the path of the molten rock burns, melts, orvaporizes within moments. The caster may direct thelava to erupt anywhere in his line of sight. System: This power costs one Willpower point in addition to a blood point. For every success on the activation roll, the initial lava burst lasts one turn. The riversof burning liquid rock then flow sluggishly for twicethis duration before suddenly cooling and hardening.Even if an object survives the heat, it now lies trappedbeneath the rock. Anything that makes contact withlava (including the koldun) suffers a minimum of threelevels of aggravated damage. For objects that don’thave health levels, the Storyteller must decide howmany turns they last before melting or erupting intotheir own inferno. A botch on this power opens thelava g
eyser under an unintended target, possibly thekoldun himself.



----Thaumaturgy

	*Thaumaturgy encompasses blood magic and othersorcerous arts available to Kindred. The Tremere Clanis best known for their possession (and jealous hoarding) of this Discipline. The Tremere created Thaumaturgy by combining mortal wizardry with the powerof vampiric vitae, and as a result it is a versatile andpowerful Discipline. Although there are whispers ofthe existence of Tremere antitribu in the Sabbat, otherClans in the Sword of Caine have also researched and developed access to such mystical might. Nevertheless,the Tremere of the Camarilla remain this Discipline’smasters.Like Necromancy, the practice of Thaumaturgy isdivided into paths and rituals. Thaumaturgical pathsare applications of the vampire’s knowledge of bloodmagic, allowing her to create effects on a whim. Rituals are more formulaic in nature, most akin to ancientmagical “spells.” Because so many different paths andrituals are available to the arcane Tremere, one neverknows what to expect when confronted with a
 practitioner of this Discipline.When a character first learns Thaumaturgy, the player selects a path for the character. That path is considered the character’s primary path, and she automatically receives one dot in it, as well as one Level Oneritual. Thereafter, whenever the character increasesher level in Thaumaturgy, her rating in the primarypath increases by one as well. Additional rituals arelearned separately, as part of a story; players need notpay experience points for their characters to learn rituals up to the level equal to their overall rating in Thaumaturgy, though they must find someone to teach therituals in question. Path ratings never exceed 5, thoughthe overall Thaumaturgy score may. If a characterreaches a rating of 5 in her primary path and increasesher Thaumaturgy score afterward, she may allocate her“free” path dot to a different path. (Experience costsare covered on p. 124.)Many Kindred fear crossing the practitioners ofThaumaturgy. It is a very potent an
d mutable Discipline, and almost anything the Kindred wishes may beaccomplished through its magic.

	**Thaumaturgical Paths :Paths define the types of magic a vampire can perform. A vampire typically learns his primary path fromhis sire, though it is not unknown for some vampires tostudy under many different tutors.As mentioned before, the first path a character learnsis considered her primary path and increases automatically as the character advances in the Discipline itself.Secondary paths may be learned once the characterhas acquired two or more dots in her primary path, andthey must be raised separately with experience points.Furthermore, a character’s rating in her primary pathmust always be at least one dot higher than any of hersecondary paths until she has mastered her primarypath. Once the character has achieved the fifth level of her primary path, secondary paths may be increasedto that level.Each time the character invokes one of the powersof a Thaumaturgical path, the thaumaturge’s playermust spend a blood point and make a Willpower rollagainst a difficulty equal to 
the power’s level +3. Onlyone success is required to invoke a path’s effect — pathlevels, not successes, govern the power of blood magic.Failure on this roll indicates that the magic fails. Abotch causes some kind of loss or catastrophic backfire,such as losing a Willpower point (or dot!), spontaneous combustion, or accidentally letting a living statuerun rampant. Thaumaturgy is an unforgiving art.Various Sects and Clans have different access to eachpath, but unless the Storyteller decides otherwise, it isassumed the Tremere have some access to all of them.(“Having access” does not mean the same thing as “easily gained,” especially within the Tremere power structure.) The paths start with one of the most common(The Path of Blood), and thereafter are presented in alphabetical order. (The unusual “path” of Thaumaturgical Countermagic is also presented, although it is considered a separate Discipline – see p. 228 for details.)



--The Path of Blood

	*Almost every Tremere studies the Path of Blood asher primary path. It encompasses some of the most fundamental principles of Thaumaturgy, based as it is onthe manipulation of Kindred vitae. If a player wishes toselect another path as her character’s primary path, theStoryteller may require additional reasoning (thoughchoosing a different path is by no means unheard of).

	1:A Taste for Blood

	*This power was developed as a means of testing afoe’s might — an extremely important ability in thetumultuous early nights of Clan Tremere. By merelytouching the blood of his subject, the caster may determine how much vitae remains in the subject and, ifthe subject is a vampire, how recently he has fed, hisapproximate Generation and, with three or more successes, whether he has ever committed diablerie.System: The number of successes achieved on theroll determines how much information the thaumaturge gleans and how accurate it is.

	2:Blood Rage

	*This power allows a vampire to force another Kindred to expend blood against his will. The caster must touch her subject for this power to work, though onlythe lightest contact is necessary. A vampire affectedby this power might feel a physical rush as the thaumaturge heightens his Physical Attributes, might findhimself suddenly looking more human, or may evenfind himself on the brink of frenzy as his stores of vitaeare mystically depleted.System: Each success forces the subject to spend oneblood point immediately in the way the caster desires(which must go towards some logical expenditure thetarget vampire could make, such as increasing PhysicalAttributes or powering Disciplines). Note that bloodpoints forcibly spent in this manner may exceed thenormal “per turn” maximum indicated by the victim’sGeneration. Each success gained also increases thesubject’s difficulty to resist frenzy by one. The thaumaturge may not use Blood Rage on herself to circumventgenerational limits.

	3:Blood of Potency

	*The thaumaturge gains such control over his ownblood that he may effectively “concentrate” it, making it more powerful for a short time. In effect, he maytemporarily lower his own Generation with this power.This power may be used only once per night.System: One success on the Willpower roll allowsthe character to lower his Generation by one step forone hour. Each additional success grants the Kindredeither one step down in Generation or one hour of effect. Successes earned must be spent both to decreasethe vampire’s Generation and to maintain the change(this power cannot be activated again until the original application wears off). If the vampire is diablerizedwhile this power is in effect, it wears off immediatelyand the diablerist gains power appropriate to the caster’s actual Generation. Furthermore, any mortals Embraced by the thaumaturge are born to the Generationappropriate to their sire’s original Generation (e.g., aTenth-Generation Tremere who has reduced his effec
tive Generation to Eighth still produces EleventhGeneration childer).Once the effect wears off, any blood over the character’s blood pool maximum dilutes, leaving the character at his regular blood pool maximum. Thus, if aTwelfth-Generation Tremere (maximum blood poolof 11) decreased his Generation to Ninth (maximumblood pool 14), ingested 14 blood points, and had thismuch vitae in his system when the power wore off, hisblood pool would immediately drop to 11.

	4:Theft of Vitae

	*A thaumaturge using this power siphons vitae fromher subject. She need never come in contact with thesubject — blood literally streams out in a physical torrent from the subject to the Kindred (though it is oftenmystically absorbed and need not enter through themouth).System: The number of successes determines howmany blood points the caster transfers from the subject. The subject must be visible to the thaumaturgeand within 50 feet (15 meters). Using this power prevents the caster from being blood-bound, but otherwise counts as if the vampire ingested the blood herself. This power is spectacularly obvious, and Camarillaprinces justifiably consider its public use a breach ofthe Masquerade.

	5:Cauldron of Blood

	*A thaumaturge using this power boils her subject’sblood in his veins like water on a stove. The Kindredmust touch her subject, and it is this contact that simmers the subject’s blood. This power is always fatal tomortals, and causes great damage to even the mightiestvampires.System: The number of successes gained determineshow many blood points are brought to boil. The subject suffers one health level of aggravated damage foreach point boiled (individuals with Fortitude may soakthis damage using only their Fortitude dice). A singlesuccess kills any mortal, though some ghouls with access to Fortitude are said to have survived after soakingall of the aggravated damage. 



--Elemental Mastery

	*This path allows a vampire limited control over andcommunion with inanimate objects. Elemental Mastery can only be used to affect the unliving — a vampire could not cause a tree to walk by using Animatethe Unmoving, for instance. Thaumaturges who seekmastery over living things generally study paths suchas The Green Path (p. 215).

	1:Elemental Strength

	*The vampire can draw upon the strength and resilience of the earth, or of the objects around him, to increase his physical prowess without the need for largeamounts of blood. System: The player allocates a total of three temporary bonus dots between the character’s Strength and Stamina. The number of successes on the roll toactivate the power is the number of turns these dotsremain. The player may spend a Willpower point toincrease this duration by one turn. This power cannotbe “stacked” — one application must expire before thenext can be made.

	2:Wooden Tongues

	*A vampire may speak, albeit in limited fashion, withthe spirit of any inanimate object. The conversationmay not be incredibly interesting, as most rocks andchairs have limited concern for what occurs aroundthem, but the vampire can get at least a general impression of what the subject has “experienced.” Notethat events which are significant to a vampire may notbe the same events that interest a lawn gnome.System: The number of successes dictates the amountand relevance of the information that the character receives. One success may yield a boulder’s memory of aforest fire, while three may indicate that it remembersa shadowy figure running past, and five will cause therock to relate a precise description of a local Gangrel.

	3:Animate the Unmoving

	*Objects affected by this power move as the vampireusing it dictates. An object cannot take an action thatwould be completely inconceivable for something withits form — for instance, a door could not leap fromits hinges and carry someone across a street. However,seemingly solid objects can become flexible within reason: Barstools can run with their legs, guns can twistout of their owners’ hands or fire while holstered, andhumanoid statues can move like normal humans. System: This power requires the expenditure of aWillpower point with less than four successes on theroll. Each use of this power animates one object nolarger than human-sized; the caster may simultaneously control a number of animate objects equal to his Intelligence rating. Objects animated by this power stayanimated as long as they are within the caster’s line ofsight or up to an hour, although the thaumaturge cantake other actions during that time.

	4:Elemental Form

	*The vampire can take the shape of any inanimateobject of a mass roughly equal to her own. A desk, astatue, or a bicycle would be feasible, but a house or apen would be beyond this power’s capacity. System: The number of successes determines howcompletely the character takes the shape she wishesto counterfeit. At least three successes are required for the character to use her senses or Disciplines while inher altered form. This power lasts for the remainder ofthe night, although the character may return to hernormal form at will.

	5:Summon Elemental

	*A vampire may summon one of the traditional spirits of the elements: a salamander (fire), a sylph (air),a gnome (earth), or an undine (water). Some thaumaturges claim to have contacted elemental spirits ofglass, electricity, blood, and even atomic energy, butsuch reports remain unconfirmed (even as their authors are summoned to Vienna for questioning). Thecaster may choose what type of elemental he wishes tosummon and command.System: The character must be near some quantityof the classical element corresponding to the spirithe wishes to invoke. The spirit invoked may or maynot actually follow the caster’s instructions once summoned, but generally will at least pay rough attentionto what it’s being told to do. The number of successesgained on the Willpower roll determines the powerlevel of the elemental.The elemental has three dots in all Physical andMental Attributes. One dot may be added to one ofthe elemental’s Physical Attributes for each successgained by the caster on the 
initial roll. The Storytellershould determine the elemental’s Abilities, attacks,and damage, and any special powers it has related toits element.Once the elemental has been summoned, the thaumaturge must exert control over it. The more powerful the elemental, the more difficult a task this is. Theplayer rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty of thenumber of successes scored on the casting roll + 4),and the number of successes determines the degree ofcontrol:

		@-1 success		The elemental immediately attacksthe thaumaturge.

		@0 success		The elemental goes free and mayattack anyone or leave the sceneat the Storyteller’s discretion.

		@1 success		The elemental does not attack itssummoner.

		@2 successes		The elemental behaves favorablytoward the summoner and mayperform a service in exchange for payment (determined by theStoryteller).

		@3 successes		The elemental performs one service,within reason.

		@4 successes		The elemental performs any one taskfor the caster that does not jeopardizeits own existence.

		@5 successes		The elemental performs any task thatthe caster sets for it, even one thatmay take several nights to completeor that places its existence at risk.



--The Green Path

	*The Green Path deals with the manipulation ofplant matter of all sorts. Anything more complex thanan algae bloom can theoretically be controlled throughthe appropriate application of this path. Ferns, roses,dandelions, and even ancient redwoods are all validtargets for this path’s powers, and living and dead plantmatter are equally affected. While not as immediatelyimpressive as some other more widely practiced paths,the Green Path (sometimes disparagingly referred to as“Botanical Mastery”) is as subtle and powerful as thenatural world which it affects.

	1:Herbal Wisdom 

	*With a touch, a vampire can commune with thespirit of a plant. Conversations held in this manner areoften cryptic but rewarding — the wisdom and experience of the spirits of some trees surpasses that of theoracles of legend. Crabgrass, on the other hand, rarelyhas much insight to offer, but might reveal the appearance of the last person who trod upon it.System: The number of successes rolled determinesthe amount of information that can be gained from thecontact. Depending on the precise information thatthe vampire seeks, the Storyteller might require theplayer to roll Intelligence + Occult in order to interpret the results of the communication.

		@1 success		Fleeting cryptic impressions

		@2 successes		One or two clear images

		@3 successes		A concise answer to a simple query

		@4 successes		A detailed response to one or morecomplex questions

		@5 successes		The sum total of the plant-spirit’sknowledge on a given subject

	2:Speed the Season’s Passing

	*This power allows a thaumaturge to accelerate a plant’sgrowth, causing roses to bloom in a matter of minutes ortrees to shoot up from saplings overnight. Alternately,she can speed a plant’s death and decay, withering grassand crumbling wooden stakes with but a touch.System: The character touches the target plant. Theplayer rolls normally, and the number of successes determines the amount of growth or decay. One successgives the plant a brief growth spurt or simulates the effects of harsh weather, while three noticeably enlargeor wither it. With five successes, a full-grown plantsprings from a seed or crumbles to dust in a few minutes, and a tree sprouts fruit or begins decaying almostinstantaneously. If this power is used in combat, threesuccesses are needed to render a wooden weapon completely useless. Two successes suffice to weaken it, whilefive cause it to disintegrate in the wielder’s hand.

	3:Dance of Vines

	*The thaumaturge can animate a mass of vegetationup to his own size, using it for utilitarian or combat purposes with equal ease. Leaves can walk along a desktop,ivy can act as a scribe, and jungle creepers can strangle opponents. Intruders should beware of Tremere workshops that harbor potted rowan saplings.System: Any total amount of vegetation with a massless than or equal to the character’s own may be animated through this power. The plants stay active for one turnper success scored on the roll, and are under the completecontrol of the character. If used for combat purposes, theplants have Strength and Dexterity ratings each equalto half the character’s Willpower (rounded down) andBrawl ratings one lower than that of the character.Dance of Vines cannot make plants uproot themselves and go stomping about. Even the most energeticvegetation is incapable of pulling out of the soil andwalking under the effect of this power. However, 200pounds (100 kilograms) of kudzu can cover a c
onsiderable area all by itself….

	4:Verdant Haven

	*This power weaves a temporary shelter out of a sufficientamount of plant matter. In addition to providing physicalprotection from the elements (and even sunlight), the Verdant Haven also establishes a mystical barrier whichis nearly impassable to anyone the caster wishes to exclude. A Verdant Haven appears as a six-foot-tall (twometer-tall) hemisphere of interlocked branches, leaves, and vines with no discernible opening, and even to thecasual observer it appears to be an unnatural construction. Verdant Havens are rumored to have supernaturalhealing properties, hut no Kindred have reported experiencing such benefits from a stay in one. System: A character must be standing in a heavilyvegetated area to use this power. The Verdant Havensprings up around the character over the course of threeturns. Once the haven is established, anyone wishingto enter the haven without the caster’s permissionmust achieve more than the caster’s original number ofsuccesses on a single roll of Wits + 
Survival (difficultyequal to the caster’s Willpower). The haven lasts untilthe next sunset, or until the caster dispels or leaves it.If the caster scored four or more successes, the haven isimpenetrable to sunlight unless physically breached.

	5:Awaken the Forest Giants

	*Entire trees can be animated by a master of theGreen Path. Ancient oaks can be temporarily giventhe gift of movement, pulling their roots from the soiland shaking the ground with their steps. While not asversatile as elementals or other summoned spirits, treesbrought to ponderous life via this power display awesome strength and resilience.

	**Once the animating energy leaves a tree, it putsdown roots immediately, regardless of what it is currently standing on. A tree re-establishing itself in thesoil can punch through concrete and asphalt to findnourishing dirt and water underneath, meaning that itis entirely possible for a sycamore to root itself in themiddle of a road without any warning.

	**System: The character touches the tree to be animated. The player spends a blood point and rolls normally. If the roll succeeds, the player must spend a bloodpoint for every success. The tree stays animated for oneturn per success rolled; once this time expires, the treeputs its roots down wherever it stands and cannot beanimated again until the next night. While animated,the tree follows the character’s verbal commands tothe best of its ability. An animated tree has Strengthand Stamina equal to the caster’s Thaumaturgy rating,Dexterity 2, and a Brawl rating equal to the caster’sown. It is immune to bashing damage, and all lethaldamage dice pools are halved due to its size.



--Hands of Destruction

	*This Path is practiced most commonly by the variousthaumaturges of the Sabbat. Though it is not widelyseen outside that Sect, a few Camarilla Tremere have managed to learn the secrets of this path over the centuries. The Hands of Destruction has an infamous history, and some Tremere refuse to practice it due to rumors that it is demonic in origin.

	1:Decay

	*This power accelerates the decrepitude of its target,causing it to wither, rot, or otherwise break down. Thetarget must be inanimate, though dead organic mattercan be affected. System: If the roll is successful, the inanimate object touched by the thaumaturge ages 10 years for everyminute the Kindred touches it. If the vampire breaksphysical contact and wishes to age the object again,another blood point must be spent and another rollmust be made. This power does not affect vampires.

	2:Gnarl Wood

	*This power warps and bends wooden objects.Though the wood is otherwise undamaged, this poweroften leaves the objects completely useless. This powermay also be used to swell or contract wood, in addition to bending it into unwholesome shapes. Unlikeother powers of this path, Gnarl Wood requires merelya glance rather than physical contact. System: Fifty pounds or twenty-five kilograms of visible wood may be gnarled for each blood point spenton this power (the thaumaturge may expend as muchblood as she likes on this power, up to her per-turngenerational maximum). It is also possible to warpmultiple visible objects — like all the stakes a team ofvampire-hunters wields.

	3:Acidic Touch

	*The vampire secretes a bilious, acidic fluid from anyportion of his body. The viscous acid corrodes metal,destroys wood, and causes horrendous chemical burnsto living tissue.

	**System: The player spends one blood point to createthe acid — the blood literally transmutes into the volatile secretion. One blood point creates enough acid toburn through a quarter-inch or half a centimeter of steelplate or three inches (seven centimeters) of wood. Thedamage from an acid-augmented hand-to-hand attackis aggravated and costs one blood point per turn to use.A thaumaturge is immune to her own acidic touch.

	4:Atrophy

	*This power withers a victim’s limb, leaving only a desiccated, almost mummified husk of bone and skin. The effectsare instantaneous; in mortals, they are also irreversible. System: The victim may resist the effects of Atrophyby scoring three or more successes on a Stamina + Athletics roll (difficulty 8). Failure means the limb is permanently and completely crippled. Partial resistanceis possible: One success indicates that the difficulty ofany roll involving the use of the arm increases by two,though these effects are still permanent with regard tomortals. Two successes signify that difficulties increaseby one. Vampires afflicted by this power may spend fiveblood points to rejuvenate atrophied limbs. Mortals arepermanently crippled. This power affects only limbs orparts of limbs (arms, legs, hands); it does not work onvictims’ heads, torsos, etc.

	5:Turn to Dust

	*This fearsome power accelerates decrepitude in itsvictims. Mortals literally age at the mere touch of askilled thaumaturge, gaining decades in moments.System: Each success on the roll ages the victim by10 years. A potential victim may resist with a Stamina + Courage roll (difficulty 8), but must accumulatemore successes than the caster’s activation roll — it’san all-or-nothing affair. If the victim succeeds, he doesnot age at all. If he does not acquire more successesthan the thaumaturge, he ages the full amount. Obviously, this power, while it affects vampires, has no detrimental effect on them (they’re immortal). At most, aKindred victim grows paler and withers slightly (-1 toAppearance) for one night.



--The Lure of Flames

	*This path grants the thaumaturge the ability to conjure forth mystical flames — small fires at first, butskilled magicians may create great conflagrations. Firecreated by this path is not “natural.” In fact, many vampires believe the flames to be conjured from Hell itself.The Lure of Flames is greatly feared, as fire is one of thesurest ways to bring Final Death upon a vampire. See“Fire” (p. 297) for more information on how vampiressuffer from flame.Fire conjured by The Lure of Flames must be releasedfor it to have any effect. Thus, a “palm of flame” doesnot burn the vampire’s hand and cause an aggravatedwound (nor does it cause the caster to frenzy) — itmerely produces light. Once the flame has been released, however, it burns normally and the characterhas no control over it.System: The number of successes determines howaccurately the vampire places the flame in his desiredlocation (declared before the roll is made). One success is all that is necessary to conjure
 a flame in one’shand, while five successes place a flame anywhere inthe Kindred’s line of sight. Less successes mean thatthe flame appears somewhere at the Storyteller’s discretion — as a rough rule of thumb, the thaumaturgecan accurately place a flame within 10 yards or metersof themselves per success.Individual descriptions are not provided for eachlevel of this path — fire is fire, after all (including potentially causing frenzy in other vampires witnessingit). The chart below describes the path level requiredto generate a specific amount of flame. To soak thedamage at all, a vampire must have the Fortitude Discipline. Fire under the caster’s control does not harmthe vampire or cause him to frenzy, but fires started asa result of the unnatural flame affect the thaumaturgenormally.

	1:Candle (difficulty 3 to soak, onehealth level of aggravated damage/turn)

	2:Palm of flame (difficulty 4 to soak,one health level of aggravateddamage/turn)

	3:Campfire (difficulty 5 to soak,two health levels of aggravateddamage/turn)

	4:Bonfire (difficulty 7 to soak, twohealth levels of aggravated damage/turn)

	5:Inferno (difficulty 9 to soak, threehealth levels of aggravated damage/turn)



--Neptune’s Might

	*Vampires are rarely associated with the ocean inmost mythologies, and most Kindred have nothingto do with water in large quantities simply becausethey have no reason to do so. Nevertheless, Neptune’sMight has enjoyed a small, but devoted, following forcenturies among Camarilla thaumaturges. This path isbased primarily around the manipulation of standingwater, although some of its more disturbing effects depart from this principle.Once a character reaches the third level of Neptune’sMight, the player may choose to specialize in eitherfresh water or salt water. Such specialization lowers allNeptune’s Might difficulties by one when dealing withthe chosen medium but raises them by one when dealing with the opposite. Blood is considered neither freshnor salty for this purpose, and difficulties in manipulating it are unaffected.

	1:Eyes of the Sea

	*The thaumaturge may peer into a body of water andview events that have transpired on, in, or around itfrom the water’s perspective. Some older practitionersof this art claim that the vampire communes with thespirits of the waters when using this power; youngerKindred scoff at such claims.System: The number of successes rolled determineshow far into the past the character can look.

		@1 success		One day

		@2 successes		One week

		@3 successes		One month

		@4 successes		One year

		@5 successes		10 years

	**The Storyteller may require a Perception + Occultroll for the character to discern very small details in thetransmitted images. This power can only he used onstanding water; lakes and puddles qualify, but oceans,rivers, sewers, and wine glasses do not.

	2:Prison of Water

	*The thaumaturge can command a sufficiently largequantity of water to animate itself and imprison a subject. This power requires a significant amount of fluidto be fully effective, although even a few gallons can beused to shape chains of animated water.System: The number of successes scored on the rollis the number of successes the victim must score on aStrength roll (difficulty 8; Potence can add to this roll)to break free. A subject may be held in only one prisonat a time, although the caster is free to invoke multipleuses of this power upon separate victims and may dissolve these prisons at will. If a sufficient quantity ofwater (at least a bathtub’s worth) is not present, thedifficulty of the Willpower roll to activate this poweris raised by one.

	3:Blood to Water

	*The thaumaturge has now attained enough powerover water that she can transmute other liquids to thisbasic element. The most commonly seen use of thispower is as an assault; with but a touch, the victim’s blood transforms to water, weakening vampires andkilling mortals in moments.System: The character must touch her intended victim. The player rolls Willpower normally. Each successconverts one of the victim’s blood points to water. Onesuccess kills a mortal within minutes. Vampires wholose blood points to this power also suffer dice poolpenalties as if they had received an equivalent numberof health levels of injury. The water left in the target’ssystem by this attack evaporates out at a rate of oneblood point’s worth per hour, but the lost blood doesnot return.At the Storyteller’s discretion, other liquids may beturned to water with this power (the difficulty for suchan action is reduced by one unless the substance is particularly dangerous or magical in nature). The chara
cter must still touch the substance or its container to usethis power.

	4:Flowing Wall

	*Tales of vampires’ inability to cross running watermay have derived in part from garbled accounts of thispower in action. The thaumaturge can animate waterto an even greater degree than is possible with the useof Prison of Water, commanding it to rise up to form abarrier impassable to almost any being.System: The character touches the surface of astanding body of water; the player spends three Willpower points and the normal required blood point androlls normally. Successes are applied to both width andheight of the wall; each success “buys” 10 feet/threemeters in one dimension. The wall may be placed anywhere within the character’s line of sight, and must beformed in a straight line. The wall lasts until the nextsunrise. It cannot be climbed, though it can be flownover. To pass through the barrier, any supernatural being (including beings trying to pass the wall on otherlevels of existence, such as ghosts) must score at leastthree successes on a single Willpower roll (diffi
culty9).

	5:Dehydrate

	*At this level of mastery, the thaumaturge can directly attack living and unliving targets by removing thewater from their bodies. Victims killed by this powerleave behind hideous mummified corpses. This powercan also be used for less aggressive purposes, such asdrying out wet clothes — or evaporating puddles tokeep other practitioners of this path from using them. System: This power can be used on any target in thecharacter’s line of sight. The player rolls normally; thevictim resists with a roll of Stamina + Fortitude (difficulty 9). Each success gained by the caster translatesinto one health level of lethal damage inflicted on thevictim. This injury cannot be soaked (the resistanceroll replaces soak for this attack) but can be healednormally. Vampires lose blood points instead of healthlevels, though if a vampire has no blood points this attack inflicts health level loss as it would against a mortal. The victim of this attack must also roll Courage(difficulty equal to the numb
er of successes scored bythe caster + 3) to be able to act on the turn followingthe attack; failure means he is overcome with agonyand can do nothing.



--Movement of the Mind

	*This path gives the thaumaturge the ability to moveobjects telekinetically through the mystic power ofblood. At higher levels, even flight is possible (but becareful who sees you…). Objects under the character’scontrol may be manipulated as if she held them — theymay be lifted, spun, juggled, or even “thrown,” thoughcreating enough force to inflict actual damage requiresmastery of at least the fourth level of this path. Somecasters skilled in this path even use it to guard theirhavens, animating swords, axes, and firearms to wardoff intruders. This path may frighten and disconcertonlookers.System: The number of successes indicates the duration of the caster’s control over the object (or subject).Each success allows one turn of manipulation, thoughthe Kindred may attempt to maintain control afterthis time by making a new roll (she need not spendadditional blood to maintain control). If the roll is successful, control is maintained. If a thaumaturge loses orrelaxes control
 over an object and later manipulates itagain, her player must spend another blood point, asa new attempt is being made. Five or more successeson the initial roll means the vampire can control theobject for duration of the scene.If this power is used to manipulate a living being, thesubject may attempt to resist. In this case, the casterand the subject make opposed Willpower rolls eachturn the control is exercised.Like The Lure of Flames, individual power levels arenot provided for this path — consult the chart belowto see how much weight a thaumaturge may control.

	** Once a Kindred reaches a rating of 3, she may levitate herself and “fly” at approximately running speed,no matter how much she weighs, though the weightrestrictions apply if she manipulates other objects orsubjects. Once a Kindred achieves 4, she may “throw”objects at a Strength equal to her level of mastery ofthis path.

	1:One pound/one-half kilogram

	2:20 pounds/10 kilograms

	3:200 pounds/100 kilograms

	4:500 pounds/250 kilograms

	5:1000 pounds/500 kilograms



--The Path of Conjuring

	*Invoking objects “out of thin air” has been a stapleof occult and supernatural legend since long before therise of the Tremere. This Thaumaturgical path enablespowerful conjurations limited only by the mind of thepractitioner.Objects summoned via this path bear two distinctcharacteristics. They are uniformly “generic” in thateach object summoned, if summoned again, would lookexactly as it did at first. For example, a knife would beprecisely the same knife if created twice; the two wouldbe indistinguishable. Even a specific knife — the one acharacter’s father used to threaten her — would appearidentical every time it was conjured. A rat would haverepeated “tiled” patterns over its fur, and a garbage canwould have a completely uniform fluted texture overits surface. Additionally, conjured objects bear noflaws: Weapons have no dents or scratches, tools haveno distinguishing marks, and cellphones all look likethey just came out of their packaging.The limit on the size 
of conjured objects appears tobe that of the conjurer: nothing larger than the thaumaturge can be created. The conjurer must also havesome degree of familiarity with the object he wishesto call forth. Simply working from a picture or imagination calls for a higher difficulty, while objects withwhich the character is intimately familiar (such as theknife described above) may actually lower the difficulty, at the Storyteller’s discretion.When a player rolls to conjure something, the successes gained on the roll indicate the quality of thesummoned object. One success yields a shoddy, imperfect creation, while five successes garner the caster anearly perfect replica.

	1:Summon the Simple Form

	*At this level of mastery, the conjurer may createsimple, inanimate objects. The object cannot have anymoving parts and may not be made of multiple materials. For example, the conjurer may summon a steelbaton, a lead pipe, a wooden stake, or a chunk of granite.System: Each turn the conjurer wishes to keep theobject in existence, another Willpower point must bespent or the object vanishes.

	2:Permanency

	*At this level, the conjurer no longer needs to payWillpower costs to keep an object in existence. Theobject is permanent, though simple objects are still allthat may be created.System: The player must invest three blood pointsin an object to make it real.

	3:Magic of the Smith

	*The Kindred may now conjure complex objects ofmultiple components and with moving parts. For example, the thaumaturge can create guns, bicycles,chainsaws, or cellphones.System: Objects created via Magic of the Smith areautomatically permanent and cost five blood pointsto conjure. Particularly complex items often require aKnowledge roll (Crafts, Science, Technology, etc.) inaddition to the basic roll.

	4:Reverse Conjuration

	*This power allows the conjurer to “banish” into nonexistence any object previously called forth via thispath.System: This is an extended success roll. The conjurer must accumulate as many successes as the originalcaster received when creating the object in question.This can also be used by the thaumaturge to banishobject she created herself with this Path.

	5:Power Over Life

	*This power cannot create true life, though it cansummon forth impressive simulacra. Creatures (andpeople) summoned with this power lack the free willto act on their own, mindlessly following the simpleinstructions of their conjurer instead. People createdin this way can be subject to the use of the Dominatepower Possession (p. 155), if desired. System: The player spends 10 blood points. Imperfect and impermanent, creatures summoned via thispath are too complex to exist for long. Within a weekafter their conjuration, the simulacra vanish into insubstantiality.



--The Path of Corruption

	*The origins of this path are hotly debated amongthose who are familiar with its intricacies. One theoryholds that its secrets were taught to the Tremere by demons and that use of it brings the practitioner dangerously close to the infernal powers. A second opinionhas been advanced that the Path of Corruption is aholdover from the days when Clan Tremere was stillmortal. The third theory, and the most disturbing tothe Tremere, is that the path originated with the Followers of Set, and that knowledge of its workings wassold to the Tremere for an unspecified price. This lastrumor is vehemently denied by the Tremere, which automatically makes it a favorite topic of discussion whenthe matter comes up.The Path of Corruption is primarily a mentally andspiritually oriented path centered on influencing thepsyches of other individuals. It can be used neither toissue commands like Dominate nor to change emotions in the moment like Presence. Rather, it producesa gradual and subtle twisting of th
e subject’s actions,morals, and thought processes. This path deals intimately with deception and dark desires, and those whowork through it must understand the hidden placesof the heart. Accordingly, no character may have ahigher rating in the Path of Corruption than he has inSubterfuge.

	1:Contradict

	*The vampire can interrupt a subject’s thought processes, forcing the victim to reverse his current courseof action. An Archon may be caused to execute a prisoner she was about to exonerate and release; a mortallover might switch from gentle and caring to sadisticand demanding in the middle of an encounter. The results of Contradict are never precisely known to thethaumaturge in advance, but they always take the formof a more negative action than the subject had originally intended to perform.System: This power may be used on any subjectwithin the character’s line of sight. The player rolls asper normal. The target rolls Perception + Subterfuge(difficulty equal to the number of successes scored bythe caster + 2). Two successes allow the subject to realize that she is being influenced by some outside source.Three successes let her pinpoint the source of the effect. Four successes give her a moment of hesitation,neither performing her original action nor its inverse,while five allo
w her to carry through with the originalaction.The Storyteller dictates what the subject’s precisereaction to this power is. Contradict cannot be used incombat or to affect other actions (at the Storyteller’sdiscretion) that are mainly physical and reflexive.

	2:Subvert

	*This power follows the same principle as does Contradict, the release of a subject’s dark, self-destructiveside. However, Subvert’s effects are longer-lasting thanthe momentary flare of Contradiction. Under the influence of this power, victims act on their own suppressed temptations, pursuing agendas that their morals or self-control would forbid them to follow undernormal circumstances.System: This power requires the character to makeeye contact (see p. 152) with the intended victim. Theplayer rolls normally. The target resists with a roll ofPerception + Subterfuge (difficulty equal to the target’sManipulation + Subterfuge). If the thaumaturge scoresmore successes, the victim becomes inclined to followa repressed, shameful desire for the length of time described below.

		@1 success		Five minutes

		@2 successes		One hour

		@3 successes		One night

		@4 successes		Three nights

		@5 successes		One week

	**The Storyteller determines the precise desire oragenda that the victim follows. It should be in keeping with the Psychological Flaws that she possesses orwith the negative aspects of her Nature (for example,a Loner desiring isolation to such an extent that shebecomes violent if forced to attend a social function).The subject should not become fixated on followingthis new agenda at all times, but should occasionally beforced to spend a Willpower point if the opportunity tosuccumb arises and she wishes to resist the impulse.

	3:Dissociate

	*“Divide and conquer” is a maxim that is well-understood by the Tremere, and Dissociate is a powerful toolwith which to divide the Clan’s enemies. This poweris used to break the social ties of interpersonal relationships. Even the most passionate affair or the oldestfriendship can be cooled through use of Dissociate, andweaker personal ties can be destroyed altogether.System: The character must touch the target. Theplayer rolls normally. The target resists with a Willpower roll (difficulty of the thaumaturge’s Manipulation + Empathy). The victim loses three dice fromall Social rolls for a period of time determined by thenumber of successes gained by the caster:

		@1 success		Five minutes

		@2 successes		One hour

		@3 successes		One night

		@4 successes		Three nights

		@5 successes		One week

	**This penalty applies to all rolls that rely on SocialAttributes, even those required for the use of Disciplines. If this power is used on a character who hasparticipated in the Vaulderie or a similar ritual, thatcharacter’s Vinculum ratings are reduced by three forthe duration of Dissociate’s effect.Dissociate’s primary effect falls under roleplayingrather than game mechanics. Victims of this powershould be played as withdrawn, suspicious, and emotionally distant. The Storyteller should feel free to require a Willpower point expenditure for a player whodoes not follow these guidelines.

	4:Addiction

	*This power is a much stronger and more potentiallydamaging form of Subvert. Addiction creates just thatin the victim. By simply exposing the target to a particular sensation, substance, or action, the caster creates a powerful psychological dependence. Many thaumaturges ensure that their victims become addicted tosubstances or thrills that only the mystic can provide,thus creating both a source of income and potentialblackmail material.System: The subject must encounter or be exposedto the sensation, substance, or action to which thecharacter wants to addict him. The thaumaturge then touches his target. The player rolls normally; the victim resists with a Self-Control/Instinct roll (difficultyequal to the number of successes scored by the caster+ 3). Failure gives the subject an instant addiction tothat object.An addicted character must get his fix at least oncea night. Every night that he goes without satisfying hisdesire imposes a cumulative penalty of one die on all ofhis dice po
ols (to a minimum pool of one die). The victim must roll Self-Control/Instinct (difficulty 8) everytime he is confronted with the object of his addictionand wishes to keep from indulging. Addiction lasts fora number of weeks equal to the thaumaturge’s Manipulation score.An individual may try to break the effects of Addiction. This requires an extended Self-Control/Instinctroll (difficulty of the caster’s Manipulation + Subterfuge), with one roll made per night. The addict mustaccumulate a number of successes equal to three timesthe number of successes scored by the caster. The victim may not indulge in his addiction over the timeneeded to accumulate these successes. If he does so, allaccumulated successes are lost and he must begin anewon the next night. Note that the Self-Control/Instinctdice pool is reduced every night that the victim goeswithout feeding his addiction.

	5:Dependence

	*Many former pawns of Clan Tremere claim to havefelt a strange sensation similar to depression when notin the presence of their masters. This is usually attributed to the blood bond, but is sometimes the result ofthe vampire’s mastery of Dependence. The final powerof the Path of Corruption enables the vampire to tieher victim’s soul to her own, engendering feelings oflethargy and helplessness when the victim is not in herpresence or acting to further her desires.System: The character engages the target in conversation. The player rolls normally. The victim rollsSelf-Control/Instinct (difficulty equals the number ofsuccesses scored by the caster + 3). Failure means thatthe victim’s psyche has been subtly bonded to that ofthe thaumaturge for one night per success rolled by thecaster.A bonded victim is no less likely to attack his controller, and feels no particular positive emotions toward her. However, he is psychologically addicted toher presence, and suffers a one-die penalty 
to all rollswhen he is not around her or performing tasks for her. Additionally, he is much less resistant to her commands, and his dice pools are halved when he attemptsto resist her Dominate, Presence (or other mental oremotional control powers), or mundane Social rolls.Finally, he is unable to regain Willpower when he isnot in the thaumaturge’s presence.



--The Path of Mars

	*Those rare Sabbat who have retained Thaumaturgical talents have turned their focus to the assistance of theSect in times of war. This path has proven useful, turning the tides of several confrontations with elder vampires. The path adopts a very martial stance, whereasother blood magics tend to have subtler, less violent effects. It is rumored that some Camarilla Tremere havelearned this path, but very few of them have the righttemperament to wield this path effectively.

	1:War Cry

	*A vampire on the attack can focus his will, makinghim less susceptible to battle fear or the powers of theundead. The vampire shouts a primal scream to start theeffect, though some thaumaturges have been known topaint their faces or cut themselves open instead.System: For the duration of one scene, the vampireadds one to his Courage Trait. Additionally, for thepurposes of hostile effects, his Willpower is consideredto be one higher (though this bonus applies only to theTrait itself, not the Willpower pool). A character mayonly gain the benefits of War Cry once per scene.

	2:Strike True

	*The vampire makes a single attack, guided by theunholy power of her Blood. This attack strikes its foeinfallibly.System: By invoking this power, the player neednot roll to see if the vampire’s attack hits — it does,automatically. Only Melee or Brawl attacks may bemade in this manner. These attacks are considered tobe one-success attacks; they offer no additional damage dice. Also, they may be dodged, blocked, or parriednormally, and the defender needs only one success (asthe attacks’ number of success is assumed to be one).Strike True has no effect if attempted on multiple attacks (dice pool splits) in a single turn from one character.

	3:Wind Dance

	*The thaumaturge invokes the power of the winds,moving in a blur. She gains a preternatural edge in avoiding her enemies’ blows, moving out of their waybefore the enemy has a chance to throw them.System: The player can dodge any number of attackswith her full dice pool in a single turn. This advantageapplies only to dodges — if the character wishes to attack and dodge, the player must still split her dice pool.This power lasts for one scene.

	4:Fearless Heart

	*The vampire temporarily augments his abilities as awarrior. Through the mystical powers of blood magic,the character becomes a potent fighting force.System: Fearless Heart grants the vampire an extrapoint in each of the Physical Attributes (Strength,Dexterity, and Stamina). These Traits may not exceedtheir generational maximums, though the player mayuse blood points to push the character’s Traits evenhigher. The effects last for one scene, and a charactermay gain its benefits only once per scene. The vampiremust spend two hours in a calm and restful state following the use of Fearless Heart, or lose a blood pointevery 15 minutes until he rests.

	5:Comrades at Arms

	*This ability extends the power of the previous abilities in the path. It allows any of the earlier effects to beapplied to a group such as a pack or War Party.System: The player chooses one of the lower-levelpowers in the path, invoking it as normal. Afterward,he touches another character and (if the roll for Comrades at Arms is successful) bestows the benefit on heras well. The same power may be delivered to any number of packmates, as long as the rolls for Comrades atArms are successful and the thaumaturge pays the appropriate blood costs.



--The Path of Technomancy

	*The newest path to be accepted by the Tremerehierarchy as part of the Clan’s official body of knowledge, the Path of Technomancy is a relatively recentinnovation, developed in the latter half of the 20thcentury. The path focuses on the control of electronicdevices, from cellphones to laptops, and its proponentsmaintain that it is a prime example of the versatility ofThaumaturgy with regards to a changing world. Moreconservative Tremere, however, state that mixingTremere magic with mortal science borders on treasonor even blasphemy, and some European Regents havegone so far as to declare knowledge of Technomancygrounds for expulsion from their chantries. The InnerCouncil did approve the introduction of the path intothe Clan’s grimoires, but has yet to voice any opinionon the conservative opposition to Technomancy.

	1:Analyze

	*Mortals are constantly developing new innovations,and any vampire who would work Technomancy mustbe able to understand that upon which he practices hismagic. The most basic power of this path allows thethaumaturge to project his perceptions into a device,granting him a temporary understanding of its purpose,the principles of its functioning, and its means of operation. This does not grant permanent knowledge,only a momentary flash of insight which fades withinminutes.System: A character must touch the device in orderto apply this power. The number of successes rolled determines how well the character understands this particular piece of equipment. One success allows a basicknowledge (on/off and simple functions), while threesuccesses grant competence in operating the device,and five successes show the character the full range ofthe device’s potential. The knowledge lasts for a number of minutes equal to the character’s Intelligence.This power can also be used to understand a non
physical technological innovation — generally a pieceof software — at +2 difficulty. The character musttouch the computer on which the software is installed— simply holding the flash drive or CD-ROM is notenough. Software applied remotely to a device (suchas through an app store) also cannot be analyzed untilit is installed.

	2:Burnout

	*It is usually easier to destroy than to create, and sensitive electronics are no exception to this rule. Burnoutis used to cause a device’s power supply (either internal or external) to surge, damaging or destroying thetarget. Burnout cannot be used to directly injure another individual, although the sudden destruction ofa pacemaker or a car’s fuel injection control chip cancertainly create a health hazard.System: A character can use this power at a rangeof up to 10 times her Willpower in yards or meters,although a +1 difficulty is applied if she is not touchingthe target item. The number of successes determinesthe extent of the damage:

		@1 success		Momentary interruption of operation(one turn), but no permanentdamage.

		@2 successes		Significant loss of function; +1difficulty to use using the device forthe rest of the scene.

		@3 successes		The device breaks and is inoperableuntil repaired.

		@4 successes		Even after repairs, the device’scapabilities are diminished(permanent +1 difficulty to use).

		@5 successes		The equipment is a total write-off;completely unsalvageable.

	**Large enough systems, such as a server cluster ora passenger aircraft, impose a +2 to +4 difficulty (atStoryteller discretion) to affect with this power. Additionally, some systems, such as military and bankingnetworks, may be protected against power surges andspikes, and thus possess one to five dice (Storytellerdiscretion again) to roll to resist this power. Each success on this roll (difficulty 6) takes away one successfrom the Thaumaturgy roll.Burnout may be used to destroy electronic data storage, in which case three successes destroy all information on the target item, and five erase it beyond anyhope of non-magical recovery.

	3:Encrypt/Decrypt

	*Electronic security is a paramount concern of governments and corporations alike. Those thaumaturgeswho are techno-savvy enough to understand the issuesat stake have become quite enamored of this power,which allows them to scramble a device’s controls mystically, making it inaccessible to anyone else. Encrypt/Decrypt also works on electronic media; a DVD underthe influence of this power displays just snow and staticif played back without the owner’s approval. Some neonates have taken to calling this power “DRM.”System: The character touches the device or datacontainer that he wishes to encrypt. The player rollsnormally. The number of successes scored is applied asa difficulty modifier for anyone who attempts to use theprotected equipment or access the scrambled information without the assistance of the character. The castercan dispel the effect at any time by touching the targetitem and spending a point of Willpower. This power may also be used to counter anotherthaumaturge
s use of Encrypt/Decrypt. The player rollsat +1 difficulty; each success negates one of the “owner’s.”The effects of Encrypt/Decrypt last for a number ofweeks equal to the character’s permanent Willpowerrating.

	4:Remote Access

	*With this power, a skilled thaumaturge can bypassthe need for physical contact to operate a device. Thisis not a form of telekinesis; the vampire does not manipulate the item’s controls, but rather touches it directly with the power of his mind.System: This power may be used on any electronicdevice within the character’s line of sight. The number of successes rolled is the maximum number of dicefrom any relevant Ability that the character may usewhile remotely controlling the device. (For instance, ifFritz has Technology 5 and scores three successes whileusing Remote Access on a keypad lock, he can onlyapply three dots of his Technology rating to any rollsthat he makes through any use of the power.) RemoteAccess lasts for a number of turns equal to the numberof successes rolled, and can only be used on one itemat a time.If an item is destroyed while under the effects of Remote Access, the character takes five dice of bashingdamage due to the shock of having his perceptionsrudely
 shunted back into his own body.

	5:Telecommute

	*A progressive derivation of Remote Access, Telecommute allows a thaumaturge to project her consciousness into the Internet, sending her mind throughnetwork connections as fast as they can transfer her.While immersed in the network, she can use any otherTechnomancy power on the devices with which shemakes contact.System: The character touches any form of communications device: a cellphone, 3G-equipped netbook,Wi-Fi tablet, or anything else that is connected directlyor indirectly to the Internet. The player rolls normallyand spends a Willpower point. Telecommute lasts forfive minutes per success rolled, and may be extended by10 minutes with the expenditure of another Willpowerpoint. The number of successes indicates the maximumrange that the character can project her consciousnessaway from her body:

		@1 success		25 miles/40 kilometers

		@2 successes		250 miles/400 kilometers

		@3 successes		1000 miles/1500 kilometers

		@4 successes		5000 miles/8000 kilometers

		@5 successes		Anywhere in the world

	**While in the network, the character can apply anyother Path of Technomancy power to any device ordata with which she comes in contact. A loss of connection, either through the destruction of a part of thenetwork or simply a loss of cell signal, hurls her consciousness back to her body and inflicts eight dice ofbashing damage.A character traveling through the Internet by meansof this power can use her Path of Technomancy powersat a normal difficulty. Using any other abilities or powers while engaged thus is done at a +2 difficulty.



--The Path of the Father’s Vengeance

	*This path, based loosely on a powerful thaumaturge’sinterpretations of the Book of Nod, devotes itself to delivering justice to the race of Cainites. Each power supposedly has some precedent in the parables of the ancient book, and focuses on teaching the lessons of Cainevia the power of blood magic. Use of this path is hotlydebated in the Sabbat, as some consider it tantamountto claiming to hold Caine’s right over all vampires oneself. Camarilla vampires don’t have the same knowledgeof the Book of Nod that the Sabbat do, but the path isnot entirely unheard of in Tremere chantries.The power of this path comes not only from themagic of blood, but also incantation of verses from theBook of Nod. For any of these powers to take effect,the caster must speak the actual condemnation. For example, to invoke the third-level power, the caster muststate plainly to his target that she may eat only ashes.The subject must generally be able to hear the casterfor these powers to take effect, 
though writing themand showing them to the subject will do.These powers apply to vampires only. They do not affect mortals, ghouls, or any other supernatural creatures.

	1:Zillah’s Litany

	*Zillah, the wife of Caine, unknowingly drank fromher husband and sire three times, thus becoming bonded to him. This power reveals existing blood bonds andVinculi to the thaumaturge.

	**System: If the subject has any blood bonds or Vinculi to other vampires, this power reveals them to thecaster. Although the caster may not know the vampires in question, this power does reveal the names andgives rough psychic impressions of the individuals inquestion.

	2:The Crone’s Pride

	*This power inflicts the curse of the crone, who boundCaine to her as he fled his wife’s spurning. Hideouslyugly, the crone had to resort to trickery to get others tohelp or serve her.System: This power reduces the target’s Appearanceto zero. All Social rolls during this time generally fail,unless the character attempts to intimidate or browbeat the subject. This power lasts for one night.

	3:Feast of Ashes

	*Primarily used against wanton or excessive vampires,this power temporarily removes a vampire’s dependency on blood. While some would say this negates theCurse of Caine, it reduces the vampire to little more than a wretched scavenger, as he must consume literalashes, though he gains little sustenance from them.

	**System: The victim of this power can no longer consume blood, vomiting it up as he would mortal food ordrink. Instead, the victim can eat only ashes, and the“blood points” he gains from this may be used only torise each night. Ashen “blood points” may not be usedto power Disciplines, raise Attributes, or feed ghouls(though actual blood points in the character’s body atthe time this power is invoked may still be used forsuch). One blood point’s worth of ash is roughly onepint or half-liter, and any ash will do — cigarette ash,campfire leftovers, or vampire corpses destroyed by fireor sunlight. This power lasts for one week.

	4:Uriel’s Disfavor

	*This power invokes the darkness of the Angel ofDeath. All but the dimmest of light causes the subjectexcruciating pain, and some artificial forms of brightlight may even damage the vampire. Uriel deliveredGod’s curse on Caine, shielding him in the blacknessof his wings.System: The presence of any light makes the subjectuncomfortable, and bright light of any kind — flash-lights, headlights, etc. — inflict one health level of aggravated damage on the character for every turn he remains under its direct focus. Most vampires who sufferthis curse elect to sleep for the duration, hiding away inthe darkness of their havens until they can walk againamong the living without pain. This power lasts forone week.

	5:Valediction

	*Many Sabbat rightfully fear this power, though veryfew have ever seen it used. It levies a punishment forbreaking one of Caine’s greatest commandments —the ban against diablerie. As most Sabbat attain theirpower and station through some measure of diablerie,they must reconcile their beliefs with the admonitionsof Caine, and this power engenders a great sense of humility.System: When this power takes effect, the subjectimmediately reverts to her original Generation. Thischange may entail losing points in certain Traits due togenerational maximums. This power lasts for one week,after which any Traits reduced to higher-Generationmaximums return to normal. It takes three turns to speakthe full verse that implements this power’s effects.



--Thaumaturgical

	1:Countermagic

	*This is less of a path than it is a separate Discipline,as the power to resist Thaumaturgy can be taught independently of Thaumaturgy, even to those Kindred whoare incapable of mastering the simplest ritual. Thoughthe techniques of Thaumaturgical Countermagic arenot officially taught outside Clan Tremere, unofficialmethods are likely to exist. Any non-Tremere whodisplays the ability to resist Thaumaturgy quickly becomes the subject of potentially fatal scrutiny from theentirety of Clan Tremere.System: Thaumaturgical Countermagic is treated asa separate Discipline, although it uses the usual rulesfor Thaumaturgy (including experience costs and thefact that it is limited to only five levels). It cannot betaken as a character’s primary path, and a rating in itdoes not allow the character to perform rituals.The use of Thaumaturgical Countermagic is treatedas a free action in combat and does not require a splitdice pool. To oppose a Thaumaturgy power or ritual, acharacter must have a T
haumaturgical Countermagicrating equal to or greater than the rating of that power or ritual. The player spends a blood point and rolls thenumber of dice indicated by the character’s Thaumaturgical Countermagic rating (difficulty equal to thedifficulty of the power in use). Each success cancels oneof the opposing thaumaturge’s successes. Thaumaturgical Countermagic is only at full effectiveness when used against Thaumaturgy. It works withhalved dice pools against Necromancy and other mystical Disciplines, and is completely ineffective againstnon-vampiric magics and powers.Thaumaturgical Countermagic can be learned bycharacters who are unable to learn Thaumaturgy (e.g.,those with the Merit Magic Resistance). Any nonTremere character with a rating in this power automatically gains the Flaw Clan Enmity (Tremere), receiving no freebie points for it. This power cannot be takenduring character creation and cannot be spontaneouslydeveloped. Whether the character has Thaumaturgy asan in-C
lan power or not, it costs the same as any othernon-Clan Discipline to learn.

	1:Two dice of countermagic. Thecharacter can attempt to cancel onlythose powers and rituals that directlyaffect him, his garments, and objectson his person.

	2:Four dice of countermagic.

	3:Six dice of countermagic. Thecharacter can attempt to cancel aThaumaturgy power that affectsanyone or anything in physicalcontact with him.

	4:Eight dice of countermagic.

	5:Ten dice of countermagic. Thecharacter can now attempt to cancela power or ritual that targets anythingwithin a radius equal to hisWillpower in yards or meters, or onethat is being used or performed withinthat same radius.



--Weather Control

	*Command over the weather has long been a staplepower of wizards both mortal and immortal, and thispath is said to predate the Tremere by millennia. Theproliferation of usage of this path outside the Clan tendsto confirm this theory; Weather Control is quite common outside the Tremere, and even outside the Camarilla. Lower levels of this path allow subtle manipulations, while higher stages of mastery allow a vampire tocall up raging storms. The area affected by this power isusually rather small, no more than three or four miles(five to six kilometers) in diameter, and the changesthe power wreaks are not always immediate.System: The number of successes rolled indicateshow long it takes the weather magic to take effect.One success indicates an entire day may pass before theweather changes to the thaumaturge’s liking, while aroll with five successes brings an almost instant effect.The difficulty of the Willpower roll necessary to invoke this power may change depending on the currentlo
cal weather conditions and the weather the character is attempting to create. The Storyteller should impose a bonus (-1 or -2 difficulty) for relatively minorshifts, such as clearing away a light drizzle or callinglightning when a severe thunderstorm is already raging. Conversely, a penalty (+1 or +2 difficulty) shouldbe applied when the desired change is at odds with thecurrent conditions, such as summoning the same lightdrizzle in the middle of the Sahara Desert or callingdown lightning from a cloudless sky.If the character tries to strike a specific target withlightning, the player must roll Perception + Occult(difficulty 6 if the target is standing in open terrain,8 if he is under shelter, or 10 if he is inside but near awindow) in addition to the base roll to use Thaumaturgy. Otherwise the bolt goes astray, with the relativedegree of failure of the roll determining where exactlythe lightning strikes.Effects of the power default to the maximum areaavailable unless the caster state
s that he’s attemptingto affect a smaller area. At Storyteller discretion, anadditional Willpower roll (difficulty 6) may be requiredto keep the change in the weather under control.Weather Control is not the sort of power that lendsitself well to indoor application. While certain ofthe path’s uses (changes of temperature, high winds,and possibly even fog) do make a certain amount ofsense in interior settings, others (precipitation of anysort, lightning) don’t. The difficulty for all rolls to useWeather Control indoors is at +2, and the Storytellershould feel free to disallow any proposed uses that don’tmake sense.Individual power descriptions are not provided forthis path, as the general principle is fairly consistent. Instead, the strongest weather phenomenon possible ateach level is listed.

	1:Fog: Vision is slightly impaired andsounds are muffled; a +1 difficulty isimposed on all Perception rolls thatinvolve sight and hearing, and theeffective range of all ranged attacksare halved.

	1:Light breeze: A +1 difficulty isimposed on all Perception rolls thatinvolve smell.

	1:Minor temperature change: It ispossible to raise or lower the localtemperature by up to 10 degreesFahrenheit or 5 degrees Celsius.

	2:Rain or snow: As Fog, butPerception rolls are impaired to amuch greater extent; the difficultymodifier for all such rolls rises to +2.In addition, the difficulty on all Driverolls increases by two.

	3:High Winds: The wind speedrises to around 30 miles per hour or50 kilometers per hour, with gusts ofup to twice that. Ranged attacksare much more difficult: + 1 tofirearm attacks and +2 to thrownweapons and archery. In addition,during fierce gusts, Dexterity rolls(difficulty 6) may be required tokeep characters from being knockedover by the winds. When gale-forcewinds are in effect, papers go flying,objects get picked up by the windsand hurled with abandon, and othersuitably cinematic effects are likely.

	3:Moderate temperature change: Thelocal temperature can be raised orlowered by up to 20 degreesFahrenheit or 10 degrees Celsius.

	4:Storm: This has the effects of bothRain and High Winds.

	5:Lightning Strike: This attack inflicts10 dice of lethal damage. Body armordoes not add to the target’s dice poolto soak this attack.
