#### Merits and flaws

	*Merits and flaws are optional Traits that a Storyteller may choose to include, or prohibit, in her chronicle. Properly used, ;erits and flaws help players create and individualize their characters. Merits are special abilities or advantages that are rare or unique in the general kindred population, while flaws are liabilities or disadvantages that pose challenges to a character’s nightly existence. These traits can provide player characters with added depth and personality, but storytellers should be careful to ensure that any traits chosen will not adversely influence the course of the chronicle or give one character an unfair advantage over the rest. Merits and flaws can be selected only during character creation and are purchased using freebie points (although existing merits and flaws can be removed or new ones added by the storyteller during the course of the chronicle). Each merit has its own point cost, while each flaw has a point value which adds to the amount of freebie p
oints a player can spend during the creation process. A character may take as many merits as the player can afford, but no character may have more than seven points worth of flaws (which would give a character a total of 22 freebie points to spend in other areas). Merits and flaws are divided into four categories: physical, mental, social and supernatural. The physical category describes merits or flaws that deal with a character’s physical makeup or abilities, while the mental category addresses intellectual abilities or patterns of behavior. The social category comprises relationships and status in kindred or mortal society, while supernatural merits and flaws concern the paranormal abilities of vampires and the way they interact with the physical world. Storytellers are encouraged to not onlyrestrict and disallow any Merits and Flaws that don’t fitwith their chronicles or for specific characters, but alsoto create their own to reflect unique elements of theirgames. Some example
 restrictions are given in the textof each Merit and Flaw, but Storytellers can allow (ordisallow) any combination that don’t make sense fortheir games.



## PHYSICAL

--Acute Sense(1pt. of Merit)

	*One of your senses is exceptionally sharp, be it sight, hearing, smell, touch, or taste. The difficulties for all tasks involving the use of this particular sense are reduced by two. This Merit can be  combined with theDiscipline of Auspex to produce superhuman sensoryacuity.



--Ambidextrous(1pt. of Merit)

	*You have a high degree of off-hand dexterity andcan perform tasks with the “wrong” hand at no penalty. The rules for taking multiple actions still apply,but you do not suffer a difficulty penalty if you use twoweapons or are forced to use your off hand.



--Bruiser(1pt. of Merit)

	*Your appearance is sufficiently thug-like to inspirefear (or at least disquiet) in those who see you. Whileyou’re not necessarily ugly, you do radiate a quiet menace, to the point where people cross the street to avoidpassing near you. All Intimidation rolls against thosewho have not demonstrated their physical superiorityto you are at -1 difficulty.



--Catlike Balance(1pt. of Merit)

	*You possess an innately perfect sense of balance.Characters with this Merit reduce difficulties of all balance-related rolls (e.g., Dexterity + Athletics to walkalong a narrow ledge) by two.



--Early Riser(1pt. of Merit)

	*No one can explain it, but you seem to have the ability to work on less rest than your fellow vampires. Youalways seem to be the first to rise and the last to go tobed even if you’re been out until dawn. Your Humanity or Path score is considered to be 10 for purposes ofdeciding when you rise each evening. Vampires withthis Merit cannot take the Deep Sleeper Flaw.



--Eat Food(1pt. of Merit)

	*You have the capacity to eat food and even savor itstaste. While you cannot derive any nourishment fromeating regular foods, this ability will serve you well inpretending to be human. Of course, you can’t digestwhat you eat, and there will be some point during theevening when you have to heave it back up.



--Friendly Face(1pt. of Merit)

	*You have a face that reminds everyone of someone,to the point where strangers are inclined to be wellinclined toward you because of it. The effect doesn’tfade even if you explain the “mistake,” leaving you at-1 difficulty on all appropriate Social-based rolls (yes for Seduction, no for Intimidation, for example) whena stranger is involved. This Merit only functions on afirst meeting.



--Blush of Health(2pt. of Merit)

	*You look more hale and healthy in appearance thanother vampires, allowing you to blend with human society much more easily. You still retain the color of aliving mortal, and your skin feels only slightly cool tothe touch.



--Enchanting Voice(2pt. of Merit)

	*There is something about your voice that otherscannot ignore. When you command, they are cowed.When you seduce, they swoon. Whether thundering,soothing, persuading, or simply talking, your voice commands attention. The difficulties of all rolls involvingthe use of the voice to persuade, charm, or commandare reduced by two.



--Daredevil(3pt. of Merit)

	*You are good at taking risks, and even better at surviving them. When attempting exceptionally riskynon-combat actions (such as leaping from one movingcar to another), characters with this Merit add an additional three dice to their rolls, and negate a singlebotch die that may result from such a roll. Generally,such actions must be at least difficulty 8 and have thepotential to inflict at least three health levels of damage if failed.



--Efficient Digestion(3pt. of Merit)

	*You are able to draw more than the usual amountof nourishment from blood. When feeding, you gainan additional point to your blood pool for every twopoints of blood you consume. This does not allow youto exceed your blood pool maximum.



--Huge Size(4pt. of Merit)

	*You are abnormally large in size, at least 6’10” and300 pounds in weight (well over two meters tall andover 130 kgs). Aside from making you extremely noticeable in public, this extra mass bestows an additional Bruised health level. Characters with this Merit mayalso gain bonuses to push objects, open barred doors,avoid being knocked down, etc.



--Hard of Hearing(1pt. of Flaw)

	*Your hearing is defective. The difficulties of any rollsinvolving the use of hearing are increased by two.



--Short(1pt. of Flaw)

	*You are well below average height — four and a halffeet (1.5 meters) tall or less. You have difficulty reaching or manipulating objects designed for normal adultsize, and your running speed is one-half that of an average human.



--Smell of the Grave(1pt. of Flaw)

	*You exude an odor of dampness and newly turnedearth, which no amount of scents or perfumes willcover. Mortals in your immediate presence becomeuncomfortable, so the difficulties of all Social rolls toaffect mortals increase by one.



--Tic/Twitch(1pt. of Flaw)

	*You have some sort of repetitive motion that youmake in times of stress, and it’s a dead giveaway as toyour identity. Examples include a nervous cough, constantly wringing your hands, cracking your knuckles,and so on. It costs one Willpower to refrain from engaging in your tic.-



--Bad Sight(1pt. or 3pt. of Flaw)

	*Your sight is defective. The difficulties of any dierolls involving the use of your eyesight are increased bytwo. As a one-point Flaw, this condition can be corrected with glasses or contacts; as a three-point Flaw,the condition is too severe to be corrected.



--Fourteenth Generation(2pt. of Flaw)

	*You were created five or fewer years ago by a member of the Thirteenth Generation. Though you have10 blood points in your body, only eight of them maybe used to heal wounds, power Disciplines, raise Attributes, etc. You can still use the final two blood pointsfor other purposes, though. The blood point costs ofnightly rising, creating and sustaining ghouls, and creating blood bonds remains the same as for other vampires. You cannot raise any Discipline above four dots.Taking this Flaw precludes you from taking the Generation Background, and you may not start with Status,either. You are likely a Clanless Caitiff, for your bloodis probably too thin to pass down the distinguishingcharacteristics of a Clan. Most Fourteenth-Generation vampires should also take the Thin Blood Flaw(p. 483).



--Fifteenth Generation(4pt. of Flaw)

	*Your vitae is so weak that only six of your 10 bloodpoints can be used for Disciplines, healing or raising Attributes. For these functions, you must expend twoblood points to obtain the effect a normal vampirewould achieve with one. (The cost for nightly risingremains a single blood point.) What’s more, you cannot create or sustain ghouls, create a blood bond, orsire a vampiric childe. You can use the remaining fourblood points to survive through the day and wake upeach night, nothing more.You cannot raise any Discipline above three dots.The weakening of the Curse of Caine has compensations, though (which distinguish this Flaw from theThin Blood Flaw itself). Sunlight does lethal damageto you, instead of aggravated damage as it does to othervampires. You can hold down mortal food and drinkfor an hour or so; other vampires vomit immediately ifthey try (unless they have the Eat Food Merit). Strangest of all, once in a while you might actually have achild the normal, human way... tho
ugh it will hardlybe a normal, human child.



--Disfigured(2pt. of Flaw)

	*A hideous disfigurement makes your appearance disturbing and memorable. The difficulties of all die rollsrelating to social interaction are increased by two. Youmay not have an Appearance rating greater than 2.



--Dulled Bite(2pt. of Flaw)

	*For some reason your fangs never developed fully,or they may not have manifested at all. When feeding, you need to find some other method of makingthe blood flow. Failing that, you must achieve doublethe normal number of successes in order to make yourbite penetrate properly. A number of Caitiff and highGeneration vampires often manifest this Flaw.



--Infectious Bite(2pt. of Flaw)

	*You may not automatically lick the wounds of yourfeeding closed. In fact, your bites have a one in fivechance of becoming infected and causing mortal victims to become seriously ill. The precise nature of theinfection is determined by the Storyteller.



--One Eye(2pt. of Flaw)

	*You have only one eye — which eye is missing is upto you. The difficulties of all Perception rolls involvingeyesight are increased by two, and the difficulties of alldie rolls requiring depth perception are increased byone (this includes ranged combat).



--Vulnerability to Silver(2pt. of Flaw)

	*To you, silver is as painful and as deadly as the rays ofthe sun. You suffer aggravated wounds from any silverweapons (bullets, knives, etc.), and the mere touch ofsilver objects discomfits you.



--Glowing Eyes(3pt. of Flaw)

	*You have the stereotypical glowing eyes of vampirelegend, which gives you a -1 difficulty on Intimidationrolls when you’re dealing with mortals. However, thetradeoffs are many; you must constantly disguise yourcondition (no, contacts don’t cut it); the glow impairsyour vision and puts you at +1 difficulty on all sightbased rolls (including the use of ranged weapons); andthe radiance emanating from your eye sockets makesit difficult to hide (+2 difficulty to Stealth rolls) in thedark.



--Open Wound(2pt. or 4pt. of Flaw)

	*You have one or more wounds that refuse to heal,and which constantly drip blood. This slow leakagecosts you an extra blood point per evening (marked offjust before dawn), in addition to drawing attention toyou. If the wound is visible, you are at + 1 difficulty forall Social-based rolls. For two points, the Flaw is simplyunsightly and has the basic effect mentioned above; forfour points the seeping wound is serious or disfiguringand includes the effects of the Flaw Permanent Wound(below).



--Addiction(3pt. of Flaw)

	*You suffer from an addiction to a substance, whichmust now be present in the blood you drink (or youautomatically frenzy, as per the Prey Exclusion Flaw).This can be alcohol, nicotine, hard drugs, or simplyadrenaline. This substance always impairs you in somefashion (see “Poisons and Drugs,” p. 301, for particulars).



--Child(3pt. of Flaw)

	*You were a small child (between five and 10 yearsold) at the time of your Embrace, leaving your PhysicalAttributes underdeveloped and making it difficult tointeract with some aspects of mortal society. You maynot have more than two dots in Strength or Staminaat character creation, except when raising Physical Attributes with blood points, and the difficulties of all dierolls when attempting to direct or lead mortal adultsare increased by two. Characters with this Flaw shouldalso take the Short Flaw.



--Deformity(3pt. of Flaw)

	*You have some kind of deformity — a misshapenlimb, hunchback, or clubfoot, for example — whichaffects your physical abilities and interactions withothers. A hunchback, for instance, would lower a character’s Dexterity by two dots and increase the difficultyof die rolls relating to social skills by one. It is the responsibility of the Storyteller to determine the specificeffects of the deformity chosen.



--Lame(3pt. of Flaw)

	*Your legs are damaged, which prevents you from running or walking easily. You are forced to walk with acane or possibly leg braces, and you have a pronouncedlimp to your stride. Your walking speed is one-quarterthat of a normal human, and running is impossible.



--Lazy(3pt. of Flaw)

	*You are simply lazy, avoiding anything that requireseffort on your part. Preferring to let others do the hardwork, you lounge around. For any action that requirespreparation, there’s a good chance you didn’t properlyprepare. Difficulty rolls for spontaneous Physical actions (including combat, unless it’s part of a plannedoffensive) increase by one.



--Monstrous(3pt. of Flaw)

	*Your physical form was twisted during the Embrace,and now reflects the Beast that rages inside you. Characters with this Flaw appear to be savage monsters andhave Appearance ratings of zero. Nosferatu and otherbloodlines whose weaknesses cause them to start offwith Appearance zero cannot take this Flaw.



--Permanent Fangs(3pt. of Flaw)

	*Your fangs do not retract, making it impossible foryou to hide your true nature. While some mortals maythink you’ve had your teeth filed or are wearing prosthetics, sooner or later you’re going to run into someone who knows what you truly are. You are also limitedto a maximum Appearance rating of 3.



--Permanent Wound(3pt. of Flaw)

	*You suffered injuries during your Embrace which yourtransformation somehow failed to repair. At the beginning of each night, you rise from sleep at the Wounded health level, though this may be healed by spendingblood points.



--Slow Healing(3pt. of Flaw)

	*You have difficulty healing wounds. It requires twoblood points to heal one health level of bashing or lethal damage, and you heal one health level of aggravated damage every five days (plus the usual five bloodpoints and Willpower expenditure).



--Disease Carrier(4pt. of Flaw)

	*Your blood carries a lethal and highly contagious disease. The disease can be anything from rabies to HIV,and Kindred who drink your blood have a 10% chanceof becoming a carrier as well. You must spend an extrablood point each night on awakening, or you will beginmanifesting symptoms of the disease (increased chanceto frenzy for rabies, reduced soak rolls for HIV, etc.).



--Deaf(4pt. of Flaw)

	*You cannot hear. While you may be more resistantto some applications of Dominate, you also may notlisten to electronic or vocal media, and the difficultiesof many Perception rolls are increased by three.



--Mute(4pt. of Flaw)

	*You cannot speak. You may communicate with theStoryteller and describe your actions, but cannot talkto player or Storyteller characters unless everyoneconcerned purchases a commonly understood signlanguage (via the Language Merit) or you write downwhat you wish to say.



--Thin Blood(4pt. of Flaw)

	*Your blood is thin, weak, and does not sustain youwell. All blood point costs are doubled (e.g., usingblood-related Disciplines or healing damage), althoughyou only lose one blood upon rising in the evening.Furthermore, you are unable to create a blood bond,and efforts to sire other vampires succeed only one infive times.



--Flesh of the Corpse(5pt. of Flaw)

	*Your flesh does not fully regenerate itself once it isdamaged. While you are able to heal yourself to thepoint of regaining full functionality, your skin stillretains the cuts, tears, bullet holes, and other visibledamage that you have incurred. Depending on the nature of the damage, this Flaw will make social dealingsexceedingly difficult, and may decrease your Appearance dots over time (even to 0).



--Infertile Vitae(5pt. of Flaw)

	*During your Embrace, something went horriblywrong, causing your blood to mutate under the stressof dying and rising again. All those you try to Embracedie. No matter what you do, you may not create anychilder. However, your blood can still be used in bloodrituals like Thaumaturgy and the Vaulderie, or for anyother vampiric needs like making ghouls.



--Blind(6pt. of Flaw)

	*You cannot see. Characters can compensate for theloss of vision by becoming more attuned to other sensory input, but visual cues and images are lost to them.Difficulties of all Dexterity-based rolls are increased bytwo. Oddly, vampires with Aura Perception (Auspex2) are still able to use this ability, thought the information is interpreted via the other senses. On the otherhand, vampires who need make eye contact to enactpowers like Dominate against you are only at a penaltyto do so (see the sidebar on p. 152).



## MENTAL

--Coldly Logical(1pt. Merit)

	*While some might refer to you as a “cold fish,” youhave a knack for separating factual reporting from emotional or hysterical coloration. You may or may not beemotional yourself, but you can see clearly when othersare clouding the facts with their feelings (-1 difficultyon all related rolls).



--Common Sense(1pt. Merit)

	*You have a significant amount of practical, everyday wisdom. Whenever you are about to act in a waycontrary to common sense, the Storyteller can makesuggestions or warnings about the implications of saidaction. This is a very useful Merit for beginning playersunfamiliar with the game.

	*You have an innate sense of time and are able to estimate the passage of time accurately without using awatch or other mechanical device.



--Useful Knowledge(1pt. Merit)

	*You have expertise in a specific field that makes yourconversation intriguing to an older Kindred. So longas your knowledge holds the other vampire’s attention,he has a vested interest in keeping you around. Thenagain, once he’s pumped you for every iota of information you possess, that patronage may suddenly vanish.(Note: This Merit should be played like a 1-dot Mentor with a specific interest. However, unlike a Mentor,Useful Knowledge does not imply a permanent relationship.)



--Code of Honor (2pt. Merit)

	*You have a personal code of ethics to which you adhere. The specifics of this code must be worked out withthe Storyteller prior to play, and the character mustfollow it strictly.

--Computer Aptitude (2pt. Merit)

	*You are familiar with and talented in the uses ofcomputer equipment. Other Kindred may not understand computers, but to you they are intuitive. All rollsinvolving computers are at -2 difficulty for you.



--Eidetic Memory (2pt. Merit)

	*You remember, with perfect detail, things you see andhear. Documents, photographs, conversations, etc.,can be committed to memory with only minor concentration.

--Light Sleeper (2pt. Merit)

	*You can awaken instantly at any sign of trouble ordanger, and do so without any sleepiness or hesitation.You may ignore rules regarding how Humanity or yourmorality Path restricts the number of dice availableduring the day.



--Nightmares (1pt. Flaw)

	*You experience horrendous nightmares every timeyou sleep, and memories of them haunt you duringyour waking hours. Upon awakening, you must makea Willpower roll (difficulty 7) or lose a die on all actions for that night. A botched Willpower roll indicates that, even when awake, you still believe that youare locked in a nightmare.



--Natural Linguist (2pt. Merit)

	*You have a flair for languages. You may add three diceto any dice pool involving written or spoken languages, and each purchase of the Language Merit (previouspage) gives you two languages instead of just one.



--Calm Heart (3pt. Merit)

	*You are naturally calm and do not easily fly off thehandle. You receive two extra dice when attempting toresist a frenzy. Brujah may not take this Merit.



--Iron Will (3pt. Merit)

	*When you are determined and your mind is set, nothing can thwart you from your goals. Characters usingDementation, Dominate, or any other mind-alteringmagic, spell, or Thaumaturgy path against your character are at +3 difficulty.Elder levels of powers like Dementation and Dominate may overwhelm even this resistance. AgainstLevel Six powers, the expenditure of a Willpower pointthrough Iron Will only raises the difficulty of the Discipline roll by two. Against Level Seven powers, the difficulty is increased by only one. Level Eight and higherpowers cannot be resisted with Iron Will.This Merit does not affect Presence or other powersdealing with the emotions. Characters will Willpowerscores below 8 cannot take this Merit.

--Prey Exclusion (1pt. Flaw)

	*You refuse to hunt a certain class of prey. You mightrefuse to feed on drug dealers, policemen, accountants,or rich people — if you accidentally feed upon suchan individual, you automatically frenzy and must makea roll to prevent Humanity or Path loss (difficulty 7).Witnessing other Kindred feeding on the object ofyour exclusion might also provoke a frenzy, at the Storyteller’s discretion. Ventrue, owing to the limitationsalready imposed on their feeding by their Clan weakness, may not take this Flaw.



--Shy (1pt. Flaw)

	*You are distinctly ill at ease when dealing with people and try to avoid social situations whenever possible. Difficulties for all rolls involving social interactionwith strangers are increased by two. If the characterbecomes the center of attention in a large group, difficulties are increased by three.

	*You cannot stand to watch others suffer. You avoidany situation that involves causing someone physicalor emotional pain, unless you make a Willpower roll(difficulty 8).

--Unconvinced (1pt. Flaw)

--Amnesia (2pt. Flaw)

	*You are unable to remember anything about yourpast, yourself, or your family (whether mortal or vampiric), though your past might well come back to hauntyou. Your origins and the circumstances behind      youramnesia are for the Storyteller to determine, and she isencouraged to make it as interesting as possible.



--Deep Sleeper (1pt. Flaw)

	*When you sleep, it is very difficult for you to awaken.The difficulty of any roll to awaken during the day isincreased by two.

 

--Impatient (1pt. Flaw)

	*You have no patience for standing around and waiting. You want to do things now — fuck those slowpokestrying to hold you back. Every time you are forced towait around instead of acting, a Self-Control roll is required to see if you go tearing off on your own instead.



--Vengeful (2pt. Flaw)

	*You have a score to settle, incurred either duringyour mortal days or after the Embrace. You are obsessedwith taking your revenge on an individual or group,and it is your overriding priority in any situation whereyou encounter the object of your revenge. You maytemporarily resist your need for vengeance by spendinga Willpower point.



--Lunacy (2pt. Flaw)

	*You are affected by the phases of the moon, increasing your chances to frenzy. Under the crescent moon,difficulties to avoid frenzy increase by one. Under thehalf or gibbous moon, difficulties rise by two. Whenthe moon is full, difficulties increase by three.



--Phobia (2pt. Flaw)

	*You have an overpowering fear of something. Spiders, snakes, crowds, and heights are examples of common phobias. You must make a Courage roll every timeyou encounter the object of your fear. The difficulty ofthe roll is determined by the Storyteller. If you fail theroll, you must retreat from the object.



--Short Fuse (2pt. Flaw)

	*You are easily angered. Difficulties to avoid frenzy aretwo greater. Brujah vampires cannot take this Flaw, asthey already suffer from a similar weakness.



--Stereotype (2pt. Flaw)

	*You buy heavily into all of the vampire stories you’veread and heard. You wear a cape or body glitter, speakwith an accent, and otherwise act in a cartoonish fashion. Such behavior is embarrassing in the extreme toother Kindred, who are likely to ostracize or mock you(+2 difficulty to Social rolls with other vampires whodon’t share your habits). You also stand out to hunters.



--Territorial (2pt. Flaw)

	*You are extremely territorial, staking out a particulararea as your hunting ground and reacting aggressivelyto trespassers. If another vampire enters your territoryuninvited, you must make a frenzy roll.

You are reluctant to leave your territoryexcept in desperate circumstances.



--Thirst for Innocence (2pt. Flaw)

--Victim of the Masquerade (2pt. Flaw)

	*The Camarilla’s propaganda machine did too good ajob on you. Even after your Embrace you refused to believe you were a vampire. You remain convinced thatthere is some logical explanation for your condition,and spend as much time as you can searching for it.You also have problems feeding, and may insist on trying to eat regular food. None of these habits makes youparticularly pleasant company for other Kindred. ThisFlaw must be roleplayed at all times, and is generallytaken by Camarilla vampires.



--Weak-Willed (3pt. Flaw)

	*You are highly susceptible to Dominate and intimidation by others; Dominate attempts automatically affectyou unless the Discipline wielder is of higher Generation, and your difficulties to resist Social abilities suchas Intimidation or Leadership, as well as mind-alteringspells or magic, are increased by two. Your WillpowerTrait may never rise above 4.



--Conspicuous Consumption (4pt. Flaw)

	*It is not enough for you to draw nourishment fromthe blood of mortals — you believe you must also consume your victim’s heart, liver, and other blood-richtissue. Of course, this will necessitate the deaths of allof your victims (unless you are extremely creative),which might lead to numerous problems with maintaining Humanity (and a low profile). Characters withthis Flaw should additionally purchase the Eat FoodMerit.



--Guilt-Wracked (4pt. Flaw)

	*You simply cannot come to grips with the fact thatyou must drink blood to survive. You suffer horribleguilt over each time you feed (roll Conscience, difficulty 7, or else frenzy every time you feed — characterswith the Conviction Virtue cannot take this Flaw) andtry to avoid doing so as much as possible. This meansthat you rarely have much blood in your system, leaving you vulnerable to both attacks and hunger-basedfrenzies.



--Flashbacks (6pt. Flaw)

	*You managed to make it through the Creation Rites orother similarly traumatic experience, but not wholly intact. The most insignificant thing can throw you into adifferent mood or state of mind, and as such your behavior is extremely unpredictable. Because of your precariousemotional state, your Willpower fluctuates. At the beginning of each story, make a Willpower roll (you may notspend Willpower for an automatic success). If you succeed,you may participate in the story as normal. If you fail, however, your Willpower score is considered to be 1 for theduration of that session, and you only have one Willpowerpoint to spend. You may roll again at the beginning of thenext session to see if you regain your Willpower.



## SOCIAL

--Elysium Regular (1pt. Merit)

	*You spend an unusual amount of time in Elysium.You see and are seen to such an extent that all of themovers and shakers of Elysium at least know who youare. Extended time spent in Elysium also gives you extended opportunities to interact with the Harpies andother Kindred of that stature — and they’ll know yourname when you approach them. This Merit is generally taken by vampires that respect and attend Elysiumon a regular basis.



--Former Ghoul (1pt. Merit)

	*You were introduced to the Blood long before youwere made Kindred. Your long experience as a ghoulgives you insight into and comfort with vampiric society. You are at -1 difficulty on all Social rolls when inthe presence of other neonates (particularly those whohaven’t been educated by their sires), and have a -1difficulty on all rolls relating to vampiric knowledge.



--Harmless (1pt. Merit)

	*Everyone in the city knows you, and knows thatyou’re no threat to their plans. While that sort of estimation may seem insulting, it’s also what’s kept youfrom being killed. No one considers you worth theirtime to deal with, and that low opinion keeps you safe.If you start acting in a way that demonstrates that youare no longer harmless, others’ reactions to you willlikely change as a result.



--Natural Leader (1pt. Merit)

	*You are gifted with a certain magnetism to whichothers naturally defer. You receive two extra dice when making Leadership rolls. You must have a Charismarating of 3 or greater to purchase this Merit.



--Prestigious Sire (1pt. Merit)

	*Your sire has or had great status in her Sect or Clan,and this has accorded you a certain amount of prestige. Though your sire may no longer have any dealingswith you, the simple fact of your ancestry has markedyou forever. This prestige might aid you greatly in dealings with other vampires, or it might engender jealousyor contempt.



--Protégé (1pt. Merit)

	*Your sire watched you for some time before Embracing you, and spoke glowingly of you to acquaintances.These vampires may be inclined to look favorably onyou by dint of your sire’s recommendation; you are at-1 difficulty on Social rolls with all those who’ve heardgood things about you.



--Rep (1pt. Merit)

	*Your fame has exceeded the bounds of your Sect. Everyone knows who you are, what you’ve done and whatyou’re supposed to have done (which might not be thesame thing). The publicity can be good or bad; whatmatters is that everybody knows your name. Whether individuals outside of your immediate social circleknow enough to match your face to your name is a different matter.



--Sabbat Survivor (1pt. Merit)

	*You’ve lived through at least one Sabbat attack orattempted recruitment. Your experience helps youanticipate situations where you might potentiallybe endangered by the Sabbat once again. You are at-1 difficulty on all Perception rolls when it comes toSabbat-based matters. This Merit is generally taken bygroups in conflict with the Sabbat, and comes into playmost frequently as a means of avoiding ambushes.



--Boon (1-6pt. Merit)

	*Someone owes you a favor. The vampire in your debtmight be the lowliest neonate in the city or might bethe Prince herself; it all depends on how many pointsthe Merit costs. You only have that single favor owedyou (unless you take the Merit multiple times), so using it properly is of paramount importance. Dependingon status and other factors, the vampire who owes youa favor may well resent his debt, and might go out ofhis way to “settle” it early — even going so far as tocreate situations from which he must “rescue” you andthus clear the slate.



--Bullyboy (2pt. Merit)

	*You’re part of the brute squad the local Sheriff orBishop calls on when he needs some muscle. As aresult, you get in on action that others miss entirely,score points with those in power, and occasionally geta chance to act outside of the law. How far outsidethe law you can go depends on circumstance and howmuch the vampire you report to likes you.



--Old Pal (2pt. Merit)

	*An acquaintance from your breathing days was Embraced at the same time you were. Fortunately, yourfriendship has endured even death and unlife, and youfind a constant source of support and aid in your oldfriend. She expects the same of you, which isn’t alwaysconvenient, but at least you each have someone tohang onto who remembers the good old nights — anddays. The Storyteller should play the Old Pal as a veryloyal Ally.



--Lawman’s Friend (2pt. Merit)

	*For whatever reason (maybe your winning smile orperhaps just your superb groveling technique), the local Sheriff or Bishop in charge of discipline likes you.He’s inclined to overlook your minor trespasses and letyou in on things you’re not supposed to know about.He even gives you warnings about occasional crackdowns and times when the higher-ups aren’t feelinggenerous. Of course, abusing this connection mightwell turn a friendly vampire into an enemy — and thechange might not be apparent until it’s too late.



--Open Road (2pt. Merit)

	*Unlike many Kindred, you like to travel. You havea solid knowledge of safe travel routes and methodologies, not to mention haven space available in any number of destinations. Unless someone out there knowsyour exact route and is specifically looking for you, youcan move between cities unimpeded by random encounters with Lupines, overzealous state troopers, andthe like.



--Sanctity (2pt. Merit)

	*This Merit is sometimes called the halo effect; everyone considers you pure and innocent, though notnecessarily naïve. You have a saint-like quality that ishard to pinpoint but cannot be denied. You are trusted, even if you are not trustworthy. At the Storyteller’sdiscretion, you tend to receive lesser punishments forwrongdoing, and you are liked by most.



--Scholar of Enemies (2pt. Merit)

	*You have taken the time to learn about and specialize in one particular enemy of your Sect. You are awareof at least some of the group’s customs, strategies, abilities, and long-term goals, and can put that knowledgeto good use. This Merit is worth a -2 difficulty for allnon-combat rolls pertaining specifically to the subjectof your specialization. On the other hand, you are at a+1 difficulty when it comes to dealing with other enemies, simply because you’re so thoroughly focused onyour field.



--Scholar of Others (2pt. Merit)

	*This Merit functions identically to Scholar of Enemies, except that it applies to a group that is not necessarily inimical to your Sect.



--Friend of the Underground(3pt. Merit)

	*While you’re not a Nosferatu, you know your wayaround the sewers, tunnels, ducts, subway tubes, andother subterranean passages of your hometown. The local Nosferatu (and any other creatures dwelling downin the muck) may not actually like you, but they’re notinclined to kill you on sight when they see you in theirterritory. You are at -1 difficulty on any rolls involvingthe subterranean world (sneaking from place to placeunderground, finding routes into sub-basements, andso on). Nosferatu cannot purchase this Merit.



--Mole (3pt. Merit)

	*You have an informer buried in one of your Sect’senemy organizations who funnels you all sorts of information as to what her peers are up to. What youdo with the information is up to you, but abusing theknowledge might be a good way to get your informerkilled. The other side has spies too….



--Rising Star (3pt. Merit)

	*You’re one of the up-and-comers in the city, a risingstar in your Sect. Everyone wants to know you and beyour friend, even as those in power groom you for positions of greater responsibility. You are at -1 difficultyon all Social rolls against any vampires in your Sectwho aren’t actively opposing your ascent.



--Broken Bond (4pt. Merit)

	*You were once blood-bound but have secretly slippedthe leash, and you are free to act as you will once more.Your regnant has no idea that you are not in fact bound, and continues to treat you as if you were. At Storyteller discretion, the experience of having been bound oncemay render you immune to ever being enthralled again.Sabbat vampires cannot take this Merit.



--Clan Friendship (4pt. Merit)

	*One particular Clan (not your own) has a special liking for you. You might have done the Clan as a whole afavor at some point, or perhaps you’re just a loud voicein support of their aims. Whatever the case, you’re at-2 difficulty on all friendly Social rolls involving members of the Clan in question. Of course, the reactionyour cozy relationship with another Clan is likely todraw from your own Clan leaders is an entirely different can of worms.



--Primogen/Bishop Friendship(4pt. Merit)

	*The ruling vampires of the city value you and youropinions. You are called in to consult on decisions, andyour recommendations carry great weight. Your position may not be an official one, but it’s powerful nonetheless.



--Botched Presentation (1pt. Flaw)

	*When your sire presented you to the Prince of thecity, you flubbed it. Now you’re convinced His Majestyhates you (whether he does or not). You need to succeed on a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) just to stand infront of the Prince or one of his duly authorized representatives without running, blubbering, or otherwisemaking a fool of yourself. This Flaw can only be takenby Camarilla vampires.



--Dark Secret (1pt. Flaw)

	*You have some sort of secret that, if uncovered,would be of immense embarrassment to you and wouldmake you a pariah in the local Kindred community.This could be anything from having murdered an elderto being a member of the Anarchs.



--Expendable (1pt. Flaw)

	*Someone in power doesn’t want you around. Maybeshe wants territory you possess, or is jealous of the attention you’re getting from a prize mortal retainer —the details are irrelevant. What does matter is that shehas the power to maneuver you into dangerous situations “for the good of the Sect,” and has no compunctions about doing so.



--Incomplete Understanding (1pt. Flaw)

	*The whole matter has been explained to you, butyou’re still not quite sure how things in your Sect work.Your imperfect understanding of the rules and regulations of your new existence means that sooner or later,you’re going to make a mistake. It’s only a matter oftime….



--Sire’s Resentment (1pt. Flaw)

	*Your sire dislikes you and wishes you ill. Given thesmallest opportunity, she will actively seek to do youharm. Your sire’s allies also work against you, and manyelders may resent you.



--Infamous Sire (1pt. Flaw)

	*Your sire was, and perhaps still is, distrusted and disliked by many of the city’s Kindred. As a result, you aredistrusted and disliked as well.



--Mistaken Identity (1pt. Flaw)

	*You look similar to descriptions of another Kindred, which cause cases of mistaken identity. This canprompt numerous awkward or even dangerous situations, especially if your “twin” has a terrible reputationor is wanted for some crime.



--New Arrival (1pt. Flaw)

	*You’ve just arrived in your new city of residence, anddon’t know anyone in the place. Existing factions maytry to recruit or eliminate you, while vampires in positions of authority size you up and take your measure.Meanwhile, your ignorance of the city’s current events,history, and politics (not to mention the personalityquirks of the vampires already in place) may cause youto make a serious blunder.



--New Kid (1pt. Flaw)

	*You’re the latest in the city to be Embraced or haveyet to prove yourself to your Sect, and everyone knowsit. That automatically puts you at the bottom of thesocial totem pole. Other neonates take every opportunity to demonstrate your inferiority, or rival packsconstantly test your worthiness to the Sabbat. Evenif someone else is added to the ranks of the unliving,you’re still regarded as something as a bit of a geek byyour peers — a distinction that can have dangerousconsequences if bullets start flying. All Social-relatedrolls are at +1 difficulty when you are dealing with other neonates. (Ancillae and elders lump you in with allthe other neonates under their general disdain.)



--Recruitment Target (1pt. Flaw)

	*Someone in one of your Sect’s enemy organizationswants you, and they want you bad. Every effort is beingmade to recruit you, willing or no, and the press gangsusually show up at the worst possible time.



--Special Responsibility (1pt. Flaw)

	*Shortly after your Embrace, you volunteered forsome task in order to gain respect and approval fromthe vampires around you. Now, you wish you had never opened your damn mouth! While you are not givenany special credit for performing this duty, you wouldlose a lot of respect if you were to stop. The natureand the details of your duty should be worked out withthe Storyteller in advance. Ideas can range from lending money to other Kindred to acting as a messengeror possibly gathering victims for ritae (such as BloodFeasts).



--Sympathizer (1pt. Flaw)

	*You have publicly expressed sympathy for some ofthe goals and policies of the enemies of your Sect. Youroutspoken views on the subject have made you suspectin the eyes of the city’s hierarchy, and you may be suspected of (or arrested for) treason.



--Enemy (1-5pt. Flaw)

	*You have an enemy, or perhaps a group of enemies,who seek to harm you. The power of the enemy depends upon how many points the player wishes tospend (five points indicate the wrath of a Methuselahor other potent supernatural foe).



--Bound (2pt. Flaw)

	*You are blood bound to another vampire. Your regnant may not necessarily treat you badly, but the factremains that your will is not entirely your own. Theknowledge gnaws at you, even as you find yourself lostin devotion to your vampiric master. Sabbat vampirescannot take this Flaw.



--Catspaw (2pt. Flaw)

	*You’ve done dirty work for someone high up in thecity’s hierarchy in the past — the Sheriff, the Bishop,or even someone higher. However, instead of grantingyou favor, your deeds have made you an embarrassmentor a liability. For the moment, your former employer’sconcern is to keep you quiet. In the long term, it’s toget rid of you.



--Escaped Target (2pt. Flaw)

	*You had targeted a mortal for the Embrace, butsomeone else got there first. You cannot stand the humiliation of being cheated of your prize, and fly into arage (+2 difficulty to avoid frenzy) whenever you seethe one who got away. This hatred may lead you intoother irrational behaviors, like Embracing enemies ofthe neonate, creating unauthorized childer, or eventrying to kill your rival. Furthermore, your petty andirrational behavior is well-known and quite noticeable,and as a result you are at + 1 difficulty on all Charismarolls until the situation is resolved.



--Failure (2pt. Flaw)

	*You once held a title in the city, but failed catastrophically in your duties. Now you are branded incompetent, excluded from circles of power and responsibility,and generally ostracized by those on their way up. Yourexclusion may make you a target for recruitment bythe Sect’s enemies (or so the whispers run, making youeven more distrusted). Conversely, the consequencesof your error might come back to haunt you.



--Masquerade Breaker (2pt. Flaw)

	*In your first nights as a vampire, you accidentallybroke the Masquerade — and were spotted doing so.Someone else covered for your mistake, but holds thefavor over you. Now you exist in fear that your errorwill be revealed. In the meantime, your “savior” takespitiless advantage of you. This Flaw can only be takenby vampires in Sects or Clans that respect the Masquerade.



--Hunted (4pt. Flaw)

	*You are pursued by a fanatical witch-hunter whobelieves (perhaps correctly) that you are a danger tohumanity. All those with whom you associate, be theymortal or Kindred, may be hunted as well.



--Old Flame (2pt. Flaw)

	*Someone you once cared deeply for is now with theenemy. He still attempts to play on your sympathies“for old times’ sake” while working against you. Unlessyou succeed on a contested Manipulation + Expressionroll against your former friend, you cannot act againsthim unless the situation becomes life-threatening.



--Rival Sires (2pt. Flaw)

	*The flip side of Escaped Target, two vampires wanted to gift you with the Embrace. One succeeded, onefailed — and she’s not happy about that failure. You, your actual sire, or both of you have become the targetof the failed suitor’s ire. Regardless, your persecutor isat +2 difficulty to refrain from frenzy in your presence.In addition, she may well be working actively to discredit or destroy you.



--Uppity (2pt. Flaw)

	*You are proud of your new status in the Sect — soproud that you’ve shot your mouth off to other Kindredand made some enemies. Wiser vampires laugh at youand chalk your rudeness up to youth, but others findyou arrogant and insulting. These enemies will take action to embarrass or harm you. Furthermore, you areat +2 difficulty on all Social rolls against any vampiresyou have alienated through your yammering — andyou may not know who they are. At Storyteller discretion, you may also be requiredto make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to keep yourmouth shut any time the opportunity presents itself foryou to brag about your pack, your Clan, or your status.



--Narc (3pt. Flaw)

	*You are known to be a snitch, an informer firmlyplanted in the pocket of the vampires in charge. Thoseon whom you might yet inform loathe you as a result,feeding you misinformation when they can in an attemptto discredit you. Given the opportunity, they might doyou mischief. Regardless, your reputation as a weasel precedes you, putting you at +1 difficulty on all Social rollsagainst those who don’t agree with your politics.



--Sleeping With the Enemy (3pt. Flaw)

	*You have some sort of intimate connection with amember of an opposing Sect or inimical Clan. You mayhave a lover, a childe, a friend, or a contact workingthe other side of the fence, but regardless of politicsyou retain a friendly (or more than friendly) relationship with your putative foe. Your close ties to someoneon the other side would be regarded as treason by yoursuperiors within the Sect, and if you are discovered,the penalty will surely be death.



--Disgrace to the Blood (3pt. Flaw)

	*Your sire regards the fact that he Embraced you tobe a titanic mistake, and has let everyone know it. Youare mocked at gatherings, taunted by your peers, andactively despised by the one who should be giving youguidance. Any request or petition you make is likely tobe looked down upon by friends of your sire, and yourachievements are likely to be discounted.



--Clan Enmity (4pt. Flaw)

	*One Clan in particular wants you dead. You have offended the entire Clan, from elders to neonates, and as aresult every member of that bloodline wants your head ona plate. The effects of the Flaw may manifest as anythingfrom very public snubs and insults to actual attempts onyour unlife. You are also at +2 difficulty on all Socialrolls relating to members of the Clan in question.



--Former Prince (3pt. Flaw)

	*Once, you held near-absolute power in a city, butthose nights are gone now. Perhaps you stepped down,perhaps you were deposed, or perhaps your city fellto the Sabbat; it matters little in your reduced state.What does matter is that the Prince in the city whereyou now dwell is aware of your prior employment, andhas concerns that you might be trying to make a comeback. The machinery of the Camarilla in the city whereyou now make your home is subtly stacked against you,and if the Prince sees an opportunity to get rid of youhe just might take it. This Flaw can only be taken byCamarilla vampires.



--Loathsome Regnant (4pt. Flaw)

	*Not only are you blood bound, but you are also inthrall to a vampire who mistreats you hideously. Perhaps you are publicly abused or humiliated; perhapsyour master forces you to commit unspeakable acts forhim. In any case, existence under the bond is a neverending nightmare, with your regnant serving to conduct the symphony of malice. Sabbat vampires cannottake this Flaw.



--Hunted Like a Dog (3pt. Flaw)

	*Another Sect or group of vampires has decided thatyou’re a target for extermination, and pursues you relentlessly. On the bright side, the enemies of your enemy may well wish to help you out, potentially garnering you allies.



--Overextended (4pt. Flaw)

	*You’ve got your fingers in too many pies, and peopleare starting to notice. You have too many ghouls, toomany retainers, or too much influence, which meansthat a lot of people have a vested interest in trimmingback your operations. These enemies take every opportunity to reduce your power and influence, and if thatmeans lying, cheating, or killing, so be it. Furthermore,your enemies block every attempt you make to moveinto new areas of control. You’re boxed in, and the boxis getting smaller.



--Probationary Sect Member (4pt. Flaw)

	*You are a defector. You turned traitor to the Camarilla, Sabbat, or other Sect, and you still have much toprove before you are accepted by the Kindred you havedefected to. Other vampires treat you with distrust andeven hostility, and your reputation might even sullythose whom you regularly associate with.



--Blood Hunted (4 or 6pt. Flaw)

	*You have been made the target of a blood hunt, andfor you to return to your home city is death. For fourpoints, this Flaw means that only your home city is offlimits to you. For six, it means that the entire Camarilla is howling for your vitae. This Flaw can only betaken by Camarilla vampires.



--Laughingstock (5pt. Flaw)

	*Somehow you’ve drawn the scorn of the local Harpies, who make you their favorite target. You are ata +2 difficulty on all Social rolls in Elysium and a +1anywhere else in the city. In addition, you are at +2difficulty to use Intimidation or any Dominate powers on anyone who has heard the stories mocking you.This Flaw can only be taken by Camarilla vampires.



--Red List (7pt. Flaw)

	*You are either being considered for or are already onthe dreaded Red List, the registry of those vampires theCamarilla most wants extinguished. Any Camarillavampire will either attack you on sight or, more likely,call in for a great deal of help.



## SUPERNATURAL

--Medium (2pt. Merit)

	*You possess the natural affinity to sense and hear spirits, ghosts, and shades. Though you cannot see them,you can sense them, speak to them and, through pleading or cajoling, draw them to your presence. You maycall upon them for aid or advice, but there will alwaysbe a price. Also, your difficulty is reduced by two for allAwareness rolls involving the spirits of the dead.



--Lucky (3pt. Merit)

	*You were born lucky — or else the Devil looks afterhis own. Either way, you may repeat any three failedrolls per story, including botches, but you may try onlyonce per failed roll.



--Magic Resistance (2pt. Merit)

	*You have an inherent resistance to the rituals of theTremere and the spells of the mages of other Clans.The difficulty of all such magic, both malicious and beneficent, is two higher when directed at you. You maynever learn magical Disciplines such as Thaumaturgyand Necromancy.



--Hidden Diablerie (3pt. Merit)

	*The tell-tale black streaks of diablerie do not manifest in your aura.



--Oracular Ability (3pt. Merit)

	*You can see and interpret signs and omens. You areable to draw advice from these omens, for they provide hints of the future and warnings of the present.When the Storyteller feels that you are in position tosee an omen, you will be required to make a Perception+ Awareness roll, with the difficulty relative to howwell the omen is concealed. If successful, you may thenroll Intelligence + Occult to interpret what you haveseen; the difficulty is again relative to the complexityof the omen.



--Deceptive Aura (1pt. Merit)

	*Your aura is unnaturally bright and colorful for avampire. You register as a mortal on all attempts toread your aura.



--Healing Touch (1pt. Merit)

	*Normally vampires can only seal the wounds theyinflict from feeding by licking them. With but a touch,you can achieve the same effect, closing the puncturewounds left by drinking blood.



--Spirit Mentor (3pt. Merit)

	*You have a ghostly companion and guide. The identity and exact powers of this spirit are up to the Storyteller, but it can be called upon in difficult situationsfor help and guidance.



--Inoffensive to Animals (1pt. Merit)

	*With rare exceptions, animals usually despise theKindred. Some flee, others attack, but all dislike beingin the presence of a vampire. You have no such problem. Animals may not enjoy being in your company,but they don’t actively flee from you.



--True Love (4pt. Merit)

	*You have discovered, perhaps too late, a true love.He or she is mortal, but is the center of your existence,and inspires you to keep going in a world of darknessand despair. Whenever you suffer, the thought of yourtrue love gives you the strength to persevere. This Merit grants you one automatic success on all Willpowerrolls, which can be negated only by a botch die. Thiscan be a great gift but also a hindrance, for your truelove may require protection and occasionally rescue.



--Additional Discipline (5pt. Merit)

	*You can take one additional Discipline (Storytellerdiscretion) as if it were a Clan Discipline. All coststo learn that Discipline are paid out as if it were native to your Clan. A character cannot take this Meritmore than once, and Caitiff vampires cannot take thisMerit.



--Unbondable(5pt. Merit)

	*You are immune to being blood bound. Tremere cannot take this Merit.



--Nine Lives(6pt. Merit)

	*Fate has granted you the opportunity to come asclose to Final Death as anyone can get and still survive.When a roll occurs that would result in your death, theroll is made again. If the next roll succeeds, then youlive — and one of your nine lives is used up. If thatsubsequent roll fails, then another reroll is made, untileither a successful roll occurs or your nine lives are usedup. The Storyteller should keep careful count of howmany lives the character has remaining.



--True Faith(7pt. Merit)

	*You have a deep-seated faith in and love for God, orwhatever name you choose to call the Almighty. Youbegin the game with one point of True Faith (see thesidebar on p. 372); this Trait adds one die per point toall Willpower and Virtue rolls. You must have a Humanity of 9 or higher to choose this Merit, and if youlose even a single point, all your Faith points are lostand may be regained only when the lost Humanity isrecovered. Individuals with True Faith are capable ofperforming magical acts akin to miracles, but the exactnature of those acts are up to the Storyteller.



--Cast No Reflection (1pt. Flaw)

	*You actually cast no reflection, just like the vampiresof legend. This can have a detrimental effect when trying to pass as a human. Vampires of Clan Lasombra automatically have this Flaw (and you may be mistakenfor one of them if you possess this).



--Cold Breeze(1pt. Flaw)

	*A chill wind follows you everywhere you go. Whileit may make for dramatic entrances, this effect also discomfits mortals (+1 difficulty on all appropriate Socialrolls) and marks you as obviously supernatural. Coldwinds sweeping through executive offices or crowdednightclubs can raise all sorts of questions.



--Repulsed by Garlic(1pt. Flaw)

	*You cannot abide garlic, and the smallest whiff of itsscent will drive you from a room unless you make a successful Willpower roll (difficulty based on the strengthof the odor).



--Touch of Frost (1pt. Flaw)

	*Plants wither as you approach and die at your touch.Your touch leeches heat from living beings, as thoughyou were made of ice.



--Cursed(1-5pt. Flaw)

	*You are the recipient of a supernatural curse. Thestrength and pervasiveness of the curse depend uponhow many points you wish to incur. Examples follow:• If you pass on a secret you were entrusted with,your betrayal will come back to harm you in some way.(1 pt.)• You stutter uncontrollably when you try to describewhat you have seen or heard. (2 pts.)• Tools break or malfunction when you try to usethem. (3 pts.)• You are doomed to make enemies of those whomyou most love or admire. (4 pts.)• Every one of your accomplishments or triumphswill eventually become soiled or fail in some way. (5pts.)



--Beacon of the Unholy(2pt. Flaw)

	*You radiate palpable evil. Clergy and devout mortals know instinctively that there is something horriblywrong with you, and react accordingly.



--Deathsight(2pt. Flaw)

	*Everything appears rotted and decayed to you. Theworld appears to you as a corpse; mortals look diseasedor skeletal, buildings seem decrepit, and your fellowKindred seem to be walking, moldering cadavers. Youare at -2 difficulty to resist all rolls based on Appearance, but by the same token you are at +2 difficultyon all Perception-based rolls. In addition, you find social interaction difficult and are at +1 difficulty on allSocial-based rolls.



--Eerie Presence(2pt. Flaw)

	*Mortals have an unconscious awareness of your undead nature, which makes then anxious and ill at easein your presence. Because of this, difficulties of all rollsrelating to social interaction with mortals are increasedby two.



--Lord of the Flies(2pt. Flaw)

	*Buzzing harbingers of decay swirl around you everywhere. Their constant presence makes it difficult foryou to interact socially (+1 difficulty when appropriate) and nearly impossible to sneak up on someoneor hide effectively. The buzzing of the flies inevitablygives you away — all Stealth rolls are at +2 difficulty.



--Can’t Cross Running Water(3pt. Flaw)

	*You believe in the old folklore, and cannot cross running water unless you are at least 50 feet (15 meters)above it. Running water is considered to be any body ofwater at least two feet (half a meter) wide in any direction and not completely stagnant.



--Haunted(3pt. Flaw)

	*You are haunted by an angry and tormented spirit,most likely one of your first victims. This spirit activelyattempts to hinder you, especially when feeding, anddoes its utmost to vent its anguish upon you and anyone in your presence. The Storyteller determines theexact nature of the spirit, its powers, and whether ornot it can eventually be laid to rest.



--Repelled by Crosses(3pt. Flaw)

	*You are repelled by the sight of ordinary crosses,believing them to be symbols of holy might. When confronted by a cross, you must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 9) or flee from the symbol for the durationof the scene. If you botch the roll, not only must youattempt to flee, but the touch of the cross can cause aggravated damage (one health level of damage per turnthat the cross touches your skin). This damage cannotbe soaked, even if the vampire possesses Fortitude.



--Grip of the Damned(4pt. Flaw)

	*There is no ecstasy in your Embrace — only terrorand pain. Mortals upon whom you feed struggle andshriek while you attempt to feed, requiring you tograpple with them for as long as you wish to take theirblood. For vampires with high Humanity, this experience may require a Humanity roll, at the discretion ofthe Storyteller. Giovanni cannot take this Flaw.



--Dark Fate(5pt. Flaw)

	*You are doomed to experience Final Death or, worse,suffer eternal agony. No matter what you do, you cannot avoid this terrible fate. At some point during thechronicle, your Dark Fate will come upon you. Evenmore ghastly is the fact that you occasionally have visions of this fate, and the malaise these images inspirerequires an expenditure of a temporary Willpowerpoint to avoid, or else you lose a die from all of your actions for the remainder of the night. It is up to the Storyteller to determine the exact nature of this fate, andwhen it will occur. This is a difficult Flaw to roleplay;ironically, though it may seem as though it removesall free will, the knowledge of one’s death can be quiteliberating.



--Light-Sensitive (5pt. Flaw)

	*You are even more sensitive to sunlight than othervampires are. Sunlight causes double normal damage,and the light of the moon can cause lethal damage in amanner similar to the sun, though it must shine directly upon you. Even bright lights hurt your eyes, requiring the use of sunglasses. Followers of Set and relatedbloodlines cannot take this Flaw, as they already havea worse version of it.
