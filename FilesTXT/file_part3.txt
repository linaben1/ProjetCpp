#### Attributes

Every Vampire character has Attributes. They represent the basic potential of every person in the world, aswell as most other living (and unliving) things. Mostpeople have Attribute ratings between 1 (poor) and3 (good), though exceptionally gifted individuals mayhave ratings of 4 (excellent) or even 5 (peak humancapacity). Some vampire elders have higher ratingsstill, while other Kindred, like the hideously ugly Nosferatu, may have ratings supernaturally lower than thehuman minimum.



## Physical

Physical Attributes define the condition of a character’s body. They indicate how strong, agile, andresilient a character is. Physical Attributes should betaken as the primary category for an action-orientedcharacter.Vampires may use ingested blood to supernaturallyaugment their Physical (and only their Physical) Attributes. For more on this, see p. 268.

## Social

Despite their often lonely fates, Kindred use humansociety like building blocks to advance their schemes.Social Attributes delineate a character’s appearance,charm, and ability to interact with society. TheseTraits are paramount in determining a character’s firstimpressions, personal dynamics, and relations withother individuals.



--Charisma

	*Charisma is a character’s ability to entice and pleaseothers through her personality. Charisma comes intoquestion when a character tries to win another character’s sympathies or encourage others to trust her.Charisma reflects the power of a character’s charm andinfluence. It governs a character’s ability to convinceothers to see her point of view. This Attribute doesn’tnecessarily indicate how the character is charismatic,whether she’s a silver-tongued charmer or a grinningbully. (These should come across through roleplayingand specialties.)

--Manipulation

	*Manipulation measures a character’s ability for selfexpression in the interests of getting others to shareher outlook or follow her whims. In short, it’s gettingothers to do what she wants. Manipulation comes into play when a character tries to influence or subtly guideanother’s behavior. Manipulation is used to trick, bluff,fast-talk, and railroad other characters. Whether or notthe characters in question actually like the manipulator is irrelevant (this is why Manipulation differs fromCharisma). After all, a skilled motivator can even employ the talents of people who hate her.Manipulation is a dangerous affair, though it is waymany Kindred primarily affect the world around them.Failed attempts at manipulation often earn the ire ofthe would-be patsy. Botching a Manipulation roll mayadd a name to the character’s list of enemies.People are manipulated every day, and typically ignore it. (“Would you run to the store for me?”) If thefact is brought to their attention, howev
er, many people become quite defensive. Manipulation can be themost powerful tool in a Kindred’s repertoire, but failurecan be disastrous. Characters with high Manipulationratings are often distrusted by those around them.

	1:A person of few (often ineffectual) words.

	2:You can fool some of thepeople some of the time, just likeanybody else.

	3:You never pay full price.

	4:You could be apolitician or cult leader.

	5:“Of course I’ll tell thePrince I was the one who tried tostake him!”

--Appearance

	*The Appearance Attribute is a measure of howwell a character makes a first impression. This may beconventional “attractiveness,” but it can also be theeffect of distinctive features, an exotic mien, an airof confidence, distinctive posture, a flair for dressingwell — anything remarkable upon initial observationcan contribute to a character’s Appearance. Indeed,Appearance is the amalgamation of many descriptivepersonal characteristics. Appearance is subconsciousand instinctual — it appeals to the lower levels of thepsyche, so it shapes first impressions and the nature ofmemories thereafter.This Trait is useful for getting potential vessels toheed your beckoning across a crowded dance floor. In situations in which first impressions are paramount, orthat involve people who view Appearance as very important, a character may have no more dice in a Socialdice pool than her Appearance rating. Thus, it is critically important to either look your best or get to knowpeople before yo
u start trying to convince them to firebomb the Justicar’s haven.

	1:Your clothes stink, you turnpeople off right away, or you’re justdamned ugly.

	2:You don’t stand out in acrowd, for better or for worse.

	3:“Let me buy you a drink.

	4:People go out of thei rway to make your acquaintance. 

	5:People never forget you.

## Mental 

Attributes define a character’s epistemiccapacities, including such aspects as memory, intelligence, awareness of one’s surroundings, and the abilityto think, learn, and react.



--Perception

	*Perception measures a character’s ability to observehis environment. This may involve a conscious effort,such as searching an area, but it is more often intuitive, as the character’s keen senses notice somethingout of the ordinary. Perception is a sensitivity to one’ssurroundings, and is seldom present in the cynical orjaded (who have seen it all before).Perception is used to determine whether or not acharacter understands a given situation or detects anenvironmental stimulus. It can warn a character of ambushes, distinguish a clue from a pile of refuse, or uncover any other hidden or overlookable detail, whetherphysical or otherwise.

	1:Perhaps you are absurdly selfabsorbed, perhaps merely an airhead.In any event, watch out for that car!

	2:The very subtle evades you,but you’re aware of the bigger picture.

	3:You perceive moods, textures,and small changes in yourenvironment.

	4:Almost nothing escapesyour notice.

--Intelligence

	*The Intelligence Attribute refers to a character’sgrasp of facts and knowledge. It also governs a character’s ability to reason, solve problems, and evaluatesituations. Intelligence also includes critical thinkingand flexibility of thought.Intelligence does not include savvy, wisdom, or common sense, as those are properties of the character’spersonality, not Traits. Even the smartest charactermay be too foolish to realize the thugs who want to“borrow” her car keys are up to no good. Characters with low Intelligence aren’t necessarily stupid (though they might be); they are just uneducated or simple thinkers. Likewise, characters with highIntelligence aren’t all Einsteins; they may be betterat rote memorization or have particularly keen judgment.

	1:Not the sharpest knife in thedrawer.

	2:Smart enough to realizeyou’re normal.

	3:More enlightened than themasses.

	4:You’re not just bright,you’re downright brilliant.

Characters withhigh Wits also manage to keep their cool in stressfulsituations.

	1:Pull my finger.

	2:You know when to bet orfold in poker.

	3:You are seldom surprised orleft speechless.

	4:You’re one of the peoplewho make others think, “Ooh, Ishould have said...” the next day.
