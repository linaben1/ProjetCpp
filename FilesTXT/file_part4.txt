#### Abilities

As mentioned before, Abilities are the Traits usedto describe what you know and what you’ve learnedto do. Whereas Attributes represent your raw potential, Abilities represent the ways you’ve learned to usethat potential. You may not need anything but brutestrength to smash through a door — but if you’re tryingto use sheer muscle power to force an engine part intoplace without breaking anything, you’d better knowsomething about mechanics. When rolling dice, you’llprobably pair an Ability with an appropriate Attribute,in order to properly depict the combination of potential and know-how that’s necessary for getting thingsdone.There are 30 Abilities: 10 Talents, 10 Skills, and10 Knowledges. Each Ability typically covers a broadrange of aptitudes. For certain Abilities (Expression,Crafts, Performance, Academics, Law, Science, andTechnology), it is best to pick a specialty (p. 96), evenif the character’s rating in the Ability is not yet 4 orhigher. Thus, a character with th
e Crafts Skill is generally versed in handiwork of all sorts, but might beparticularly adept at auto mechanics.



## Talents

Talents describe what you intuitively know, whatyou can do without coaching or instruction. The onlyway to improve your Talents is through direct experience — with the exception of a very few cases (such asstudying a text on Jeet Kune Do to learn a single dotof Brawl), these things can’t be learned from a book oran Internet video. If you try an action involving a Talent your character doesn’t possess, there’s no penalty toyour basic Attribute dice pool. Talents are so intuitive that virtually everyone can execute them with somedegree of capacity.



--Alertness

	*This is your basic knack for noticing things that goon around you, even when you’re not actively lookingfor them.

--Awareness

	*Awareness is an instinctual reaction to the presenceof the supernatural. It differs from Alertness (whichmeasures sensitivity to mundane events) and Occult (which covers actual knowledge about the supernatural). Usually, only supernatural creatures have accessto this particular Talent, but some unique mortals havea sense that something is strange in the world (such asthose with True Faith – see p. 372).Characters with Awareness sometimes get hunches,chills, or sudden flashes of inspiration when they arenear supernatural creatures, objects, or events. Thisinsight is purely subconscious, and knowing that something’s wrong doesn’t mean that the character knowswhat it is. To get more specific information, the Kindred will need to use Occult or a particular power –Awareness only makes the vampire more receptive tothe presence of the unusual.A vampire can use Awareness deliberately if he suspects that something is supernatural, but more oftenthe Storyteller can ask for an Awarenes
s roll to determine whether a vampire notices a strange event that’snot immediately visible.
