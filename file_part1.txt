#### Clans			

--Assamite

	*The childer of Haqim, known as Assamites to therest of the Kindred, are a silent knife in the dark, anorder of bloodthirsty assassins who participate in thesecret wars of the undead by operating as killers forhire. Outside the purview of the Sects, the Assamitesare true independents and mercenaries, hiring out towhoever can pay their blood-price and ungoverned bythe will of Prince or Priscus. By the time a mark realizesthat he’s being hunted by an Assamite, it’s often far toolate. Needless to say, this makes the Assamites bothfeared and reviled by many of the other Clans.In truth, the Assamites are more than simple thugsand killers. Theirs is a complex but insular Clan predicated upon the three principles of wisdom, sorcery, anddiablerie. Most Assamites that other vampires encounterare members of the warrior caste, however, so Kindredsociety has painted them all with that brush. For theirpart, the Assassins have done nothing to stop this misunderstanding. If it helps them acquir
e contracts and it occludes the true nature of their Clan, the better for them. Long ago, the Assamites were brought to heel by apowerful curse to curb their bloodlust, levied by theTremere at the behest of the Camarilla. They cannottaste the vitae of vampires without it causing themharm. In their ongoing quest to lower their Generationand bring themselves closer to their holy figure, Haqim(whom some outside scholars claim was of the SecondGeneration, while others insist he was a judge appointed by the other Antediluvians), the Assamites must refine the blood of Kindred into an alchemical solution.Were it not for this mystical yoke, the Assamites wouldsurely be unchecked on a crusade of unholy diablerie.

	Nickname:Assassins

	Background:Those Embraced into Clan Assamite tendto fall into two distinct types: The “provincial” members ofthe Clan fit whatever their locality is, and can blend seamlessly in with the people around them. The higher-profile“jet-setters” transcend cultures, bolstered by their abilityto handle interpersonal and intellectual challenges.

	Sect:For the most part, the Assamites tend to beindependent, letting the Sects hire them to operate ontheir own terms. That said, some Assamites believe anallegiance with the Camarilla or the Sabbat would allow the entire Clan to stand more strongly.

	Haven:Assamites often share communal havenswith others of their local cell, remote structures thatallow the Assassins to watch the larger domain from adistance. These havens are generally well appointed,but not so lavish that the whole place can’t be movedon short notice. Individual Assamites also tend to keeppersonal hideouts of a much more humble nature, forwhen they need a place to lay low.

	Appearance:Older Assamites often come from Middle Eastern and North African cultures, though more andmore young Assamites come from a wider demographic. In traditionalenvironments, the Assamites prefer garbappropriate to religious or Clan custom.When in public, however, Assamites wearwhatever the localsdo, allowing them tofulfill their contractswithout anyone noticing anythingamiss. An Assamite’s skin grows darker with age (as opposed to other vampires, whose skin gets paler); particularly ancientAssamites are almost ebony in complexion.

	Character Creation:Physical Attributes tend to beprimary, with some Assamites favoring Social Attributes to help them get close to their prey. Talents and Skills are equally favored, but Knowledges may helpthe wise Assamite in a pinch. Few Assassins cultivateextensive Backgrounds, and instead specialize in anarray of Disciplines that heighten their competence.The most accomplished Assamites follow the Clan’sunique Path of Enlightenment, and those who don’toften have to spend a great deal of effort maintainingtheir Virtues and Humanity.

	Clan Disciplines: Celerity, Obfuscate, Quietus

	Weaknesses:Due to the Tremere blood-curse,should an Assamite consume the blood of anotherKindred, she suffers one automatic level of unsoakable lethal damage per blood point imbibed. Diablerieattempts result in automatic aggravated damage, onehealth level per point of permanent Willpower the victim possesses; the would-be diablerist gains no benefits(including Generation reduction) if he survives theprocess. In addition, Assamites must tithe some of theprofits from their contracts to their sires or superiors(generally around 10 percent of all such earnings).

	Organization:An insular, hierarchical organization shapesmuch of Assamite custom. “The Old Man on the Mountain”— the master assassin who makes his haven in the mountain fortress of Alamut — is the ultimate authority, and theClan heeds the orders that trickle down to them with a mix of reverence and terror. Individual and local cells of Assamites known as falaqi frequently have license to act withautonomy, but “turncoats” against the higher cause are rare.



--Brujah

	*The legacy of the Brujah is one of halcyon greatness marred by their own fiery natures. Theirs was the glory of ancient Carthage, but Ventrue treachery in ancientRome brought the dream to an end. Since then, theBrujah have borne a grudge.Tonight, the Brujahare rebels andprovocateurs,bat-swinginghooligans and agents of change in a society long crippled by stasis. Asrebels, it’s in their nature to challenge the status quo —though sometimes, without adequate opposition, theyembody the status quo themselves. It works out fine,because there’s always a hot-blooded Brujah waiting inthe wings to bring down an uppity Clanmate growntoo comfortable in the role of rebel-turned-dictator.More so than any other Clan, the Brujah still feel theflames of the passions that once inspired them as mortals.Clan Brujah loves a cause and is quick to act on a stirringspeech, accusation of injustice, or a call to arms. Thisconnection to passion can be a blessing, but inspirationcan also yield to the mad
ness and hunger of the Beast.No wise Prince turns his back on the Brujah, and rareis the Brujah who would allow herself to be manipulatedor pandered to. A Brujah is her own master, first andforemost, and those who would bring her to heel face aterrible task. A Brujah who thinks she’s getting theshort end of the stick will tear an enemy to ribbonsfirst and maybe remember to ask questions later, nomatter if he’s a Primogen or a mortal authority.Some Kindred historians claim that the Brujahhave parlayed their ancient betrayal into a roleas agitators against the very order that they helpsupport. Others claim the Brujah have long sincesubmitted to the will of that same order, beinglittle more than loyal opposition rendered impotent. Most Brujah don’t care either way, as longas someone needs a good ass-kicking and theycan be the ones to deliver it.

	Nickname:Rabble

	Background:As creatures of passion, Brujah oftenEmbrace without really thinking much about it, andtheir childer tend to be a disparate lot. Sometimes, theRabble Embrace those who share a similar outlook orenthusiasm for a cause as the prospective sire. Othertimes, they inflict the Embrace on those of opposite ideology, cursing a rival with vampirism as punishment.

	Sect:For all its rebellion, ClanBrujah generally considers itself a member of the Camarilla. Young Rabble sometimeslook to thewildness ofthe Sabbat,but elders assert that the Ivory Tower provides a fine structureagainst which to rage.

	Haven:Brujah may feel kinship to a city, but they rarely develop such ties to individual locations. Thus, at anygiven time, a Brujah probably has a half-dozen or morehideouts, safehouses, and flats available. These are oftenshabby and ill-kept until the Brujah needs them. Brujahhavens might also have mortals who follow the Brujah’sideology or his cult of personality. This works out fine: Itnever hurts to have a spare vessel in an emergency.

	Appearance:Many Brujah affect styles and mannerisms that reflect an attitude of rebellion. Multicoloredhair, shaven heads, spikes, rivets, fetish gear, and t-shirtswith bold slogans might appeal to a Brujah. While notevery Brujah wears the “uniform,” the Rabble often enjoyadorning themselves in outfits intended to provoke. Someyoung Brujah prefer mobile devices as their tools of resistance, and can summon a riot at the touch of a screen.

	Character Creation:Brujah are usually — thoughnot exclusively — drawn from mortals with violentor ungovernable personalities. Their Natures and Demeanors are often similar, as Brujah have little use forguile. They lean toward physical Attributes, with Social and Mental about equal afterwards. Many favorSkills and Talents, but most respect the Knowledgesthat make them more than just thugs. Contacts, Allies,and Herd are common Backgrounds.

	Clan Disciplines: Celerity, Potence, Presence

	Weaknesses:The same passions that inspire Brujah to greatness or depravity, left unchecked, can sendthem into incandescent rages: The difficulties of rollsto resist or guide frenzy (p. 298) are two higher thannormal. Additionally, a Brujah may never spend Willpower to avoid frenzy, though he may spend a point ofWillpower to end a frenzy that has already begun.

	Organization:Certain causes rise and fall in Brujahfashion, but some of the more tenured are those who callthemselves Idealists and Iconoclasts. Iconoclasts want to tear it all down, while Idealists enjoy solving problemsthrough theory. This last harkens somewhat to the classical roots of the Brujah as philosopher-kings, and most Idealists are among the ranks of Brujah ancillae and elders.



--Followers of Set

	*Addiction, debasement, corruption, and desperationstrike fear into many Kindred who worry that theirswill become an unlife of ruin, but to the Followers ofSet, these and more are the tools ofthe trade. Pimps, pushers, andpriests, the Setites cater tothe needs of the desperate,and convert them to a nihilistic cause in doingso. Whether one needsflesh, money, drugs, ordark secrets, the Followers of Set can provide it, and whenthey do so, they all but guarantee themselves a return visit fromthose who seek them.The Followers of Set are as much a chthonic religion as they are a Clan, though the faith includes theClan. Its mythology is complex and convoluted, an impenetrable pantheon of god-monsters. At the apex ofthis worship stands a syncretism of the Egyptian Lordof the Underworld Set and the Greek hydra Typhon,as much spiritual guardians of secret places as they arethe “liberators” of other’s souls. To outsiders, this is allblasphemous religious affectation, but to devout Setites
, the cult and cause are real, and their dark lordworks his will through them.Needless to say, the politics of desperation and theplacation of evil gods place the Serpents on the outsideof Kindred society. The Setites are fine with this. TheKindred can often find themselves in need of whatthe Followers of Set purvey, and the extra “service”of secrecy is one the Setites are happy to provide —at a premium. The Setites offer a devil’s deal, buton their own terms. That way, when they collecttheir due and feed blood and souls into the maw ofthe Typhonic beast, all of its sacrifices have beengiven willingly.

	Nickname:Setites, Serpents

	Background:Prospective childer for the Followers ofSet often spend some time involved with a Setite cult,so they’re indoctrinated in the mysteries of the Clanbefore becoming one of its Kindred. They may comefrom any cultural origin, though many are outsiders,loners, or otherwise marginalized by society, which isoften what led them to the forbidden fruits offered bythe cult of Set in the first place.

	Sect:Externally, none of the Sects will havethe Followers of Set. Internally, the Setitessometimes describe themselves in terms ofboth Sect and Clan. They have no real impetus to join either the Camarilla or Sabbat,and their goals are different from those of theAnarchs.

	Haven:Where their hidden temples stand, the Setites make their havens, either individually or communally. These may be anything from “churches” withnever-before-heard-of denominations or they may beoutright cults that have to hide their existences. Thesecretive Serpents sometimes hide individual havensin places where other Kindred don’t often go, such asinsular ethnic neighborhoods, abandoned domains,“the rough part of town,” and so forth. Some Setitesalso haven in secret mystical places that have value tothe Clan, guarding them from outsiders.

	Appearance:Many older Setites hail from theNorth African and Mediterranean ethnicities native tothe Serpents’ historical territory, but they freely Embrace from among the mortals of their adopted homes.Some long-standing Setite temples are tied to locations where “Egyptian” Serpents might seem out ofplace, but where some aspect of serpent mythology is present, as in Mesoamerica or even far-flung Nordic locales, and thus draw their membership from local populations. Red hair is considered a mark of Set’s favor.

	Character Creation:Sires choose those who demonstrate acumen in Social and Mental Attributes, as theClan needs its proselytizers and its priests to be charismaticand quick-witted. Knowledges are almost always primary,though Talents may be so instead, especially among thoseSerpents engaged in dealings with others. Setites focuson Backgrounds that give influence over others whethersubtly or overtly, making Allies, Contacts, Influence, Resources, and sometimes Retainers popular.

	Clan Disciplines: Obfuscate, Presence, Serpentis

	Weaknesses:Given their origins in darkness, the Serpents react negatively to bright light: Add two healthlevels to damage caused by exposure to sunlight. Setitesalso lose one die from dice pools for actions taken inbright light (police spotlights, stage lights, flares, etc.).

	Organization:Setite organization is mostly local,with a single temple or network of cults representinga city’s Serpent presence. Setites in the cities rarelyscheme among each other, preferring to face outwardthreats in unity rather than the schismatic self-interestof the Sects. Whispers persist of a massive temple devoted to Set located somewhere in Africa, with a terrible Methuselah who claims to be the childe of Sethimself at the head. If this is true, then the Clan’shigher agenda probably originates here, but the Setitesthemselves remain silent on the topic.



--Gangrel

	*A glint of red eyes in the darkness, the scent of apredator’s musk, a flash of fangs, the sound of fleshtearing: These mark the presence of the Gangrel. Morethan any other Clan, the Gangrel resemble the beastsassociated with the legends of vampires: bats, wolves,and other creatures of darkness. Indeed, the Outlanders may develop the ability to transform themselvesinto these and other, more primal forms.The Gangrel have other characteristics in common withanimals as well. Many shun the elaborate social constructsof both Kindred and kine. A number of them prefer tomove alone or as a member of small packs or coteries. Mostare tough and, when pressed, ferocious. And when Gangrel succumb to the depredations of the Beast, they are leftwith some feature redolent of the animal kingdom.As a Clan, the Gangrel are wary and aloof. Most wouldprefer to spend their nights stalking prey or wilding onthe rooftops than minding Princely edicts or lobbyingfor recognition of domain. Theirs is a tense 
relationshipwith vampire society, and Outlanders are among themost frequent to turn Anarch or Autarkis. In somelocalities, the Gangrel have collectively abandonedmembership in any Sect — insofar as the Gangreltruly ever do anything collectively. The Jyhad seems less pronounced amongthe Gangrel than it is among other Clans, andthe Outlanders have little regard for the eternal conflict. Differences between Gangrel moreoften fall along the lines of domain and feeding rightsthan they do on generational mistrust, and the thingsthat concern young Outlanders are matters that concernGangrel ancillae and even elders. Still, one would behard-pressed to consider the relationship amongGangrel of different generations amicable,except in isolated sire-childe situations.The Beast is ever suspicious of thosewho would take sustenance from it.

	Nickname:Outlanders

	Background:Gangrel sire childer like they seek prey:after long hunts during which the prospective childedoesn’t even know she’s being followed. Creating afledgling means sharing limited resources, so each sirechilde relationship is unique and significant. Outlanders Embrace because they choose an individual, notout of whim or recklessness. Those who earn their attention are hardy, whether physically or emotionally.

	Sect:The Gangrel at least nominally belong tothe Camarilla, but the Clan has always had a vocal faction that spurns membership in any Sect. They claim that political games and social structures do nothingfor the primal Gangrel.

	Haven:Gangrel often lair where they can, takingrefuge when the sun threatens to rise. Those who domaintain permanent havens often lean toward the utilitarian: Everything from a cave to a covered alley to anillegal squat may serve as a Gangrel haven, usually withlittle demarcating them as any sort of personal territory(until it’s too late for the unfortunate interloper).

	Appearance:Personal presentation is often not highon the list of many Gangrel priorities, and a Gangrel’sappearance is often morea matter of circumstance than it is ofactive decision.The Clan’s weakness can contribute a great deal totheir appearance,as does an extended unlife in theplaces wherethey maketheir havens, which are frequently short of modern conveniences.

	Character Creation:Sufficiency is the Gangrel hallmark, and many have outsider or loner personalityarchetypes. Physical Attributes are far and away mostfrequent, as are Talents with a smattering of Skills andKnowledges. Many Gangrel focus on Disciplines rather than Backgrounds, preferring to rely on themselvesmore than others. Gangrel almost never have significant Resources, Influence, or Retainers.

	Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Fortitude, Protean

	Weaknesses:Every time a Gangrel frenzies, sheacquires a temporary animal characteristic (whichmay replace an existing temporary one). A patch offur, a brief torpor after feeding, or skittishness aroundcrowds — all of these may mar an Outlander after frenzy. Characteristics acquired in Gangrel frenzies neednot only be physical – they can be behavioral as well.Players should work with the Storyteller to determinewhat new animal trait is acquired (whether the frenzyinvolved the fight-or-flight impulse may be relevant).Over time, or in an exceptional situation, a particular animal feature may become permanent, with thenext frenzy adding a new feature. A good guideline isto require each frenzy-gained trait to have some effectgrounded in system terms (such as the temporary reduction of Social Attribute dots or a permanent loss ofHumanity), though some Storytellers may allow narrative-only traits that can shape the story.

	Organization:Regional groups of Gangrel occasionally assemble in convocations that draw from ethnic orcultural influences. These are informal affairs, gearedmore toward sharing information and revelry thanadvancing any cogent agenda. Aside from these infrequent gatherings, almost all Gangrel organization isvery local where it exists at all, from pairs of sire-andchilde through terrifying packs centered around oneaccomplished Outlander.



--Giovanni

	*Achieving prominence during the Venetian Renaissance, the Giovanni family built their fortune on therise of the middle class and the ready profit of banking and Mediterranean trade (and the criminal enterprise that came with it). However, with the family’srise came hubris, as its paterfamilias sought evermore power, and with that hubris came horror.With his earthly power at its apex, AugustusGiovanni turned to the arts of controllingthe dead, and in doing so, gained the Embrace from a forgotten Antediluvian.With a conclave of conspirators, theGiovanni plunged a now-forgottenClan into oblivion and built theirown legacy on its corpse. Since those first nights, the Giovanni have accepted no limits ontheir ambitions, despite oppositionfrom Kindred outside their Clanand a well-deserved reputation as“Devil Kindred.” They studied forbidden arts, becoming formidablein the nigrimancy that allowedthem power over the spirits ofthe departed, and degeneracyfollowed in the wake of uncleanri
tual. To this night, the Giovanni are known for the insularnature of their Clan and theincestuous practices by whichthey populate it. A few outsidefamilies and factions fall underGiovanni auspices, but the vastmajority of the Clan comes fromthe debased mortal family. Thefamily remains successful despiteall of their ghastly peccadilloes,and has amassed a vast wealththrough crime, politics, and thesecrets of the dead that keepsthem in their position of degraded opulence. In public view, the Giovanni make a great show of humility and respect. Part of this gentility is a habit of centuries, still in place from when the other Clans huntedthe usurping Necromancers (and to preserve their hardwon neutrality from the conflict between the Camarillaand the Sabbat). Another part of it is the velvetglove hiding the iron fist of their nature, remarkable for forcing ghosts, minds, and bodies aliketo bow to their needs. To hear the Giovannitell it, Princes and Archbishops alike owethem favors, and an
yone with somethingto offer may earn their patronage. For the most part, the Giovanni participate little in the Jyhad,pursuing their own agenda ofcultivating wealth and building afoundation of power in the landsbeyond the veil of death. Outsidersrarely comprehend the goals of theNecromancers, but only the mosttrusted of the Giovanni knowthat the Clan wants to plungethe world into a state where thedead and the living commingle.And with their mastery of Necromancy, the Giovanni wouldbe positioned to rule it all.

	Nickname:Necromancers

	Background:Giovanni of the main family branchhave usually spent some amount of time as a ghoul in apractice known as the Proxy Kiss. During this time, theKindred-to-be learns about the treacherous and jealousreality of the vampire family. She learns ambition and anunhealthy dose of duplicity, in addition to the family history and customs. Giovanni rarely see much of the outsideworld on their own terms during the Proxy Kiss period,and often become insular and alienated, while at the sametime eager to stand out among the other family ghouls.

	Sect:''

	Haven:The family wealthof the Giovanni is evident in their havens, which may take the form of villas or lavishestates. The Necromancers often have valuables investedin their havens as well, such as galleries of fine art or displays of jewelry. Many Giovanni also maintain secondary havens, where they may have elaborate necromanticcrypts or just flats where they can lie low if necessary.

	Appearance:Outwardly, Giovanni dress with subtlety andtaste. Much of the Clan comesfrom the original mortal family,and have not only olive Italiancomplexions, but some amountof inherited family features.Those outside the immediatefamily often appear “of a type,”and in the traditional garb oftheir regional family branch.

	Character Creation:Giovanni vampires often haveoutgoing, professional Demeanors that hide unpleasantNatures warped in their upbringing. Social or MentalAttributes are usually primary, though some of the “soldiers” of the family prefer Physical Attributes. Emphasislikewise usually falls on primary Knowledges or Talents,depending on proclivity. A split in the Clan sees thosewho favor the practicality of Backgrounds (particularlythose tied to wealth and exerting influence) diverge fromthose who prefer the forbidden puissance of Disciplines.Few Giovanni could be described as well-rounded.

	Clan Disciplines: Dominate, Necromancy, Potence

	Weaknesses:The Kiss of a Giovanni vampire causesexcruciating pain in mortal vessels who receive it. Ifthe Giovanni isn’t careful, her vessel may die of shockand agony before being wholly exsanguinated. When aGiovanni feeds upon a mortal, she does twice as muchdamage as the Kiss of another vampire would inflict. Forexample, if a Giovanni takes one point of blood from amortal vessel, that victim would suffer two health levels of damage. As a result, they tend to use blood banksand other means of feeding that don’t fight as much.

	Organization:Like few other Clans, the Necromancershave a top-down organization where policy is made by a(presumed) still-active Clan progenitor, Augustus. Thefamily maintains an enormous palazzo known as the Mausoleum in Venice, where elders and fledglings alike danceto the whims of their ancient puppetmasters. Clan structure is itself familial, with the added complications thatdegeneracy and vampirism offer. Incest, ancestor worship, necrophilia, cults of guilt, and bizarre relationshipsin which fathers and grandmothers are their own issue’schilder make a mire of the Clan and family, and fracturemany Giovanni long before they become Kindred.



--Lasombra

	*To the mind of a Lasombra, it is better to reign inhell than to serve in heaven. Fear, frenzy, the powerto determine whether another lives or dies: these areat the root of the power that the Lasombra hold dear.Whereas other vampires try vainly to hold the Beast atbay or give themselves wholly to it, the Lasombra beatthe Beast into submission,invoking it when itsuits them but leaving it trapped insidewhen they wish togovern themselves.It is with thesepredilections thatthe Lasombra stylethemselves a “darknobility,” an aristocracy of the night thatchose the supremacyof the Cainites overveneration of theMasquerade. Their regard for such ideas as redemption and salvationare cynical at best, and much of the pomp that shapedthe Clan’s pre-Sabbat outlook remains only with asense of blackest irony or open mockery. The grandeurand rituals of the Church and aristocracy remain dearto the Lasombra, however, and the Clan was instrumental not only in establishing many of the rituals ofthe Sa
bbat, but in the institutions that keep it fromdescending into chaos each night.Whether they see themselves as God’s instrumentsor as outcasts from His creation, the Lasombra believethey have a duty (whether to Sect, Clan, pack, or evenjust themselves), and obligation to their responsibilitiesgives them a wicked sense of purpose. Even a Lasombrashovelhead may consider himself a cut above the rest; asurprising number of Lasombra mass Embraces survive,perhaps owing to the intervention of their sires.While the night belongs to all Kindred, the Lasombra are truly born to darkness, to the degree that theirvery Clan name reveals their tie to shadow. Theirs isthe Discipline of Obtenebration, and it allows themto wield the stuff of shadow and darkness, and evenreach beyond the darkness of the physical world intothe abyss that lies beyond.

	Nickname:Keepers (as in “my brother’s…”)

	Background:Prospective sires of Clan Lasombraseek both erudition and ambition in their potentialchilder. As such, many Lasombra come from professional backgrounds, and display outgoing and evenaggressive personalities. Merit in their sires’ eyes takesfledgling Lasombra far, and the Keepers do not hesitateto cull their ranks of flawed, lazy, or boorish childer.

	Sect:The Sabbat would be very different withoutthe influence of the Lasombra, and they remain itsmost prominent Clan. Young Lasombra often makeauspicious starts as Sabbat Ducti or Priests, leadingtheir fellows by charging into the fray or demonstrating mastery of the Beast.

	Haven:The obligation of their leadership leads manyyoung Lasombra to maintain communal havens with other members of their pack. Wealthier Keepers andthose who predate the Sect often maintain their ownhavens, whether sinister penthouse suites or sprawlingOld World villas.

	Appearance:The Lasombra are frequently attractive.Whether through the Spanish, Italian, and Moorishstock associated with the Clan, or due to more cosmopolitan modern backgrounds, the Keepers cut a striking figure. Their dress is often conservative or religious,drawing on years of ceremony and faithful ritual. Rareis the Lasombra who cannot at least manipulate shadows to affect a dramatic entrance or enigmatic pose.

	Character Creation:Lasombra often have disparate Natures and Demeanors. Mental or Social Attributesare equally likely to be primary. Attributes tend to benarrow and specialized, showing individual expertise.Keepers cultivate Backgrounds of all types similarlyin (initially) low quantities, to better diversify themselves.

	Clan Disciplines: Dominate, Obtenebration, Potence

	Weaknesses:Lasombra vampires cast no reflections.Whether in a mirror, in a body of water, on a polishedsurface, or in the rear-view of a taxicab, the image ofthe Keeper does not reflect.

	Organization:For the Lasombra, the nights of higharistocracy never faded, and the titles and offices amodern onlooker might associate with history still carry great weight among the Keepers. A complex systemof patronage, mentorship, and lineage characterizesthe Clan, similar to the courts and churches of centuries gone by. Childer benefit greatly from esteemedsires and vice versa, while acts that confer Sect or Clanstatus may also elevate a Lasombra’s peers, so long asshe associates her success with her fellows.



--Malkavian

	*Clan Malkavian is twice damned: once by the curseof being Kindred, and again by the turmoil that disturbs their hearts and minds. Upon the Embrace, every Malkavian is afflicted with an insurmountableinsanity that fractures her outlook for every nightthereafter, making her unlife one of madness.Some consider this a form of oracular insight,while others simply consider them dangerous.Make no mistake: Malkavian insanity is apainful, alienating phenomenon, but it occasionally provides the Lunatics with bursts of insight or heretofore unknown perspective. Madnessfor the Malkavians may take the form of any clinicalform of insanity, or it may be a hyperacuity of sensesothers don’t know they have; a supernatural puppeteer pulling the Malkavian’s strings, or a sense thatthe Malkavian is somehow ahead of evolutionaryschedule. A Malkavian may believe herself tobe an idea given physical form or an avatar ofsome concept the World of Darkness has yetto encounter. She may be a nonstop ravening
psychopath, or may be a mostly lucid individual sometimes rendered catatonic by fear ofan impending cosmic cataclysm.Their precarious stability makes it hard for otherKindred (or, indeed, any vessels with whom they maymeet) to interact with Malkavians. The Clan sometimes indulges in elaborate, terrifying, and dangerous“pranks” which do little to endear them to other vampires. These incidents are nominally meant to educatethe target, but the lesson can often be lost between thevampire’s scramble for safety and the inability to parsethe Malkavian’s inner logic. Common pranks might beto replace a vain Toreador’s haven door with a guillotine or to redistribute a Brujah elder’s wealth while he’sat Elysium, or it might take the form of giving a hunterthe location where the Nosferatu gather. Kindred bothdread and resent the word “prank” almost as much asthey do the Lunatics themselves.

	Nickname:Lunatics

	Background:Malkavians Embrace with all the capriceone would assume from them. Lunatic childer come fromall economic and cultural strata, though most havesome sort of hard-luck story or black secret behindthem that caused their sire to take note. Truly damaged Malkavians who are unaware of the meaningsof their actions may not even be aware that theyhave sired childer, which makes for very difficultentry into Kindred society for these castoffs, manyof whom end up among the Caitiff.

	Sect:In their moments of lucidity, the Malkavians offer their unorthodox perspectives and Devil’s advocacy tothe Camarilla, offering their visions and unique insightsto cut through the webs of deceit. Princes and Primogentolerate the Lunatics to varying degrees, but the Clan as awhole has always been a supporter of the Ivory Tower.

	Haven:Consistency is rare among Malkavians.Quite simply, they establish havens where they thinkto, where they can, and where they can recall. A significant number of Malkavians have literally no home,spending each night where exhaustion or the sun’s raysleave them. Others may permanently have the presidential suite in a posh hotel, a squat in the Barrens,the dispensary at a county jail, or a broom closet in ahistorical landmark.

	Appearance:While Malkavians can come from anyculture, the madness following the Embrace tends tolead them to extremes of self-presentation. Malkaviansmay appear disheveled, injured, or simply dirty. Theycould still be wearing the same clothes from the nightof their Embrace or they may have stolen clothes froma laundromat or a department store during a fit of confusion or fugue. Of course, Malkavians are just as likely to be meticulous and exacting in their appearance, trying obsessively to appear as normal as possible.

	Character Creation:Loner, outsider, and deviantconcepts and archetypes prevail among the Malkavians, as do Mental Attributes (with an occasionalSocial-primary madman or Physical-primary maniachiding among the ranks). Talents and Knowledgesare likely most popular among Malkavians. Backgroundstend to be either broad and shallow or few and deep, representing the way the way the Malkavian caroms throughunlife. Virtues, Humanity, and Paths often tumble quickly, usually in the wake of Willpower doing the same.

	Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Dementation, Obfuscate

	Weaknesses:All members of Clan Malkavian suffer froma permanent, incurable derangement. They may acquire andrecover from other derangements, and may spend Willpowerto ameliorate the effects of the derangement for a scene, butthey can never recover from their original derangement.

	Organization:Rumor is more widespread than truth withregard to Malkavian organization, and any number of harrowing tales describe the function of the Clan. Some saythe Lunatics all share a hive consciousness; others claimthat this is in fact the lingering consciousness of the Clan’sprogenitor Malkav. Still others claim that a network ofmadness puts all Malkavians in contact with one another and is the cause of their crippling insanity. If nothingelse, the Malkavians prove inscrutable and uncanny. One night, each of them frenzies when they see one another,while the next night, they all converge at the same timeat the Sheriff’s haven and accuse him of harboring Sabbatspies. Who can say how the “disease of information” or thecustoms of the Clan travel among them?



--Nosferatu

	*Those who doubt that the Embrace is a curse needlook no further than the Nosferatu. Twisted by themark of Caine, members of Clan Nosferatu are warpedby the Embrace into hideous monsters. As such, theyskulk and keep to the shadows, and they often rouse theire and mockery of other Kindred for their nightmarish appearances. Still others are so terrified or revoltedby the Nosferatu that these warped Kindred have littlesocial interaction at all.To their credit, the Nosferatu cometo possess many of the whispered secrets of their reluctant fellows. The SewerRats enjoy a grudging respect asthe information-brokers of the Kindred, given their supernatural acumen at stealth and the fact that many Kindredwould rather ignore them than acknowledge them.Savvy Nosferatu exploit this for all it’s worth, turningthe hypocrisy of other vampires to their own profit.On the whole, the Nosferatu condition is lonely andalienating. How they react to the Curse of Caine varies with their outlook and mental s
tamina, but it’s hardto be an object of utter revulsion and not let it shapeone’s disposition toward one’s “Kindred” in some way.Some of the Sewer Rats are cruel, as blighted on the inside as they are on the outside, while others are tragic,wretched creatures who have been cursed with eternaloutsider status through no choice of their own. A fewof the Sewer Rats even position themselves as prophetsor avatars of the Damned, physically embodying thehaunting riddle, “A Beast I am, lest a Beast I become.”

	Nickname:Sewer Rats

	Background:The Sewer Rats mostly fit into one oftwo categories. Some Nosferatu Embrace the damaged,flawed, outcast, or vile, feeling some degree of kinshipwith them. Other Embrace spitefully, dragging thebeautiful or privileged into an immortal hell of disfigurement and monstrosity.

	Sect:Clan Nosferatu belongs at least nominally tothe Camarilla, though many of its members becomeAutarkis or support the Anarchs rather than navigating the Ivory Tower’s vicious social labyrinth. Someeven contend that the Nosferatu need the Camarilla,because without they have no buyers in their economyof secrets.

	Haven:Nosferatu Kindred often make their havensfar from the scorn and spite of other vampires. Whether they construct warrens in the sewers suggested by theirnickname or they sculpt a sprawling nightmare-nest inthe spire of a condemned church, Sewer Rats value secrecy and distance from rivals in their havens. Nosferatu of humbler means may well squat in an abandonedtenement or a disused alley. So long as it’s away fromother Kindred, it’s a good haven.

	Appearance:Physical horror is the lot of the Nosferatu, and their unsettling deformations are countless.No two Nosferatu share the exact same malformation, and the Clan is a freakshow of snarled limbs,fanged protrusions, hellish countenances, serpentine spines, ruined faces, spasmodic appendages, andeven features not usually seen on the mortal stockfrom which the Nosferatu are drawn. The SewerRats often hide these disfigurements under shapeless robes and rags, but some exult in the discomforttheir presence causes, and don’t bother disguisingthem. They may even emphasize them.

	Character Creation:Many Nosferatu come fromloner and outsider concepts, Natures, and Demeanors.They favor Physical and Mental Attributes over Social, and they tend to be balanced in their regard forTalents, Skills, and Knowledges. Nosferatu prefer tospecialize rather than generalize in Backgrounds, favoring those that carry favors and information like Allies,Contacts, Mentor, and even a bit of Influence.

	Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Obfuscate, Potence

	Weaknesses:All Nosferatu have an Appearancescore of zero, and they may never improve it. Cross itoff the character sheet. Dice pools that use the Appearance Trait are inherently difficult for these hideousKindred.

	Organization:Occasionally, a coterie of Nosferatubecomes a brood or cult, often based around a remotewarren. These can sprawl into vast “kingdoms” of Sewer Rats, who often exist without the knowledge of a domain’s Prince or Archbishop. The Nosferatu are amongthe Kindred most likely to share a communal haven, ifonly for protection in numbers. As well, Nosferatu shareinformation with each other via networks — whetherdigital, personal, occult, or something less definable —that defy the comprehension of other Kindred.



--Ravnos

	*The Ravnos move like the rumors that surroundthem. They are the thief in the night, the rakshachased by the wind, the nightmare-dream too fearfulto be real. Whether associated with the Romani folkof Europe or the grave-robbing ghûl of Western Asia,Kindred society burdens the Ravnos with prejudices offoulness, uncleanliness, and wickedness.With reputations like these, the Ravnos are considered outsiders even among those Kindred whodo not ally themselves with Sects. Many youngRavnos tend toward nomadic unlives, moving from one domain to the next or hidingon the fringes of established territorieswhere they can escape if local Kindredsentiment turns against them. This exacerbates their reputations as transients, gypsies, and vagrantscourges, but Ravnosvampires adapt well,thriving in theirmarginalized role. Infact, many choose tomake themselves intothe ravening terrorsthat other Kindred believe them to be. The Ravnos practice a unique Discipline known asChimerstry that convinces their e
nemies that they seethings that do not exist. Chimerstry does much to convince Kindred that the Ravnos trade in lies and misdirection, but it can also prove to be a Deceiver’s salvation and ease the vagaries of an outcast unlife. The more enlightened among the Ravnosfollow a Clan ideologyinspired by the cycle ofreincarnation espousedby many Indian faiths.Among some young andunprincipled members of theClan, however, this philosophy becomes a penchant forcapriciousness or an excusefor chaos. It is these latterKindred who give so manyRavnos a bad name, buteven the devout seem bizarre to many vampires.

	Nickname:Deceivers

	Background:The Ravnos arescattered and suspicious, and thosechilder who don’t have the tendency toward self-sufficiency don’t last long. In manycases, a Ravnos will either never sire, or sire for companionship or safety, with little concern for how wella childe will fare as a vampire. Ravnos rarely seek outchilder actively, instead drawing from those whosepaths they cross on any given night. As such, the hardluck drifter reputation tends to follow the Deceivers.

	Sect:Clan Ravnos often has a difficult time heeding the rigorous orderof many Camarilla cities, and hasno inherent love for the violence ofthe Sabbat. Thus, the Deceivers findthemselves independent for lack of amore suitable option.

	Haven:Many Ravnos take to theroad instead of establishing permanent havens, dwelling temporarily among itinerant communities,at roadside rest stops, or even in vehicles. When a Deceiver does putdown roots in a domain, his permanent haven is often away fromhigh-profile Kindred territories.Havens in ethnic ghettos, industrial outskirts, and isolated geography are safest and most easilycultivated for the Ravnos.

	Appearance:Young Ravnos often come from Eastern European Romanistock, with a relative paucity of “non-gypsy”gadje in the ranks. What few elders ofthe Clan may remain are presumed tocome from Indian or Middle Easternorigins. Given that the Clan is widelyspread and holds no traditional centraldomain, no consistent look can be saidto be predominant, and any mendicantKindred might be of Ravnos origin.

	Character Creation:Outsider and selfish Naturesare common among the Clan. Physical and Social Attributes predominate, as do Talents and Skills. SavvyRavnos develop a breadth of Backgrounds that cangive them an edge when they’re on the move or in atight spot, such as stashed Resources, defensible Domain, and a few Allies or Contacts.

	Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Chimerstry, Fortitude

	Weaknesses:A turbulent history makes the Ravnosslaves to their vices. Each Ravnos has a penchant forsome sort of vice — lying, cruelty, or theft, for example.When presented with the opportunity to engage in thatvice, the Ravnos must indulge it unless her player succeeds on a Self-Control or Instincts roll (difficulty 6).

	Organization:The Ravnos are a far-flung Clan, withlittle to unite them and an open acknowledgementthat each Deceiver looks after his own interests first.That said, Ravnos often like to make a great show ofClan camaraderie and cultural ritual, even though theyknow that promises made to one another are as fleeting as whispers on a night wind. Deceivers have beenknown to ally against common enemies such as tyrantPrinces or Sabbat pogroms, but these alliances quicklyfade once the threat no longer exists.



--Toreador

	*From the Toreador perspective, when the sun fades,darkness gives rise to an eternal and wondrous world.Everything is fraught with wonder and terror, low politics and sensual glories, the profound and the profane,and an undeniable undercurrent of the sanguinary.These Kindred are the Toreador, and they spendunlives ensconced in pleasure.Of course, for vampires of this disposition,it’s easy to become jaded and bitter. Morethan the other Clans, Toreador oftensuccumb to ennui, or fight the eventualboredom of unchanging immortalityby playing at rivalries. An excess ofstimulation turns them intoslaves to the sensations theyseek. The most debasedToreador can become truemonsters, sinking tounimaginable levels ofdepravity in order to feelanything at all.The Kindred of Clan Toreadoroften involve themselves greatly inthe world of mortals. They haveany number of reasons, whetherenjoying proximity to the blushof life, cultivating veritable cultsof doting followers, or influencingand following t
he trends that theirown kind simultaneously mock andvenerate. To hear the Toreador tellit, they are the Muses of a desperatemortal world, inspiring through their beauty or patronage. Toreador culture is a mixture of sybarites, dilettantes, and visionaries. SomeToreador, with echoes of mortal passion,Embrace lovers or “project” progeny whoseem to fly in the face of every Toreadorcustom. These either don’t last long orrise to great prominence as subversivesand individualists. Ideas, trends, and “the next great thing” spread through the Clan, andother Kindred often look to the Toreador to guidethem. The Degenerates know this, and many becomeHarpies, Princes, and other key figures in vampiric society.

	Nickname:Degenerates

	Background:Many Toreador hail from high-societyor “bohemian” backgrounds. Indeed, many are themselves artists or influential among local art scenes orother subcultures. Actors, singers, musicians, sculptors,poets, playwrights, authors, and creative folk of anystripe may well find a home in the Clan, as do thosewho serve as patrons to (or travel in the entourages of)those artistic types.

	Sect:The Camarilla would not have survived in the nights following the Anarch Revolt without substantial participationfrom the Toreador, and they remain amongits most ardent supporters.

	Haven:The Degeneratesspare no expense in appointing their havens in luxury,often with many originalworks of art. It is a point ofpride among Toreador tohave an unconventional(and thus memorable)haven with moderncomforts; thus, manyhave striking lofts andpenthouses, while thebolder among them renovate or repurpose everything from abandonedaquariums or deconsecrated churches to rooftop gardens or converted warehouse-galleries in fashion-forward neighborhoods. Share a communal haven? Howdéclassé.

	Appearance:Almost to the last, theyare attractive in some way, whetherthe traditional beauty of a runway model or the dangerous allure of something more predatory.The Degenerates augment theirphysical beauty with a sense ofpersonal style, which may takethe form of expensive couture, avant-garde street wear,or classical fashions designedto emphasize their appealing qualities. This isn’t to saythat ugly Toreador don’t exist.Indeed, those gifted with lessphysical beauty often go thatmuch further with their choiceof accoutrements.

	Character Creation:Social attributes are almost always primary, with an even split among Talents, Skills,and Knowledges depending on how the Toreadordistinguishes herself. Toreador also love to cultivateBackgrounds. Allies, Contacts, Resources, Domain,Haven, Mentors, Resources, Retainers — all of thesehave great value among Toreador. Wise Toreador maychoose to develop their Virtues, Humanity, Path, orWillpower, because with an unlife of degeneracy, theymust frequently attend to the ugly business of bringingthe Beast to heel.

	Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Celerity, Presence

	Weaknesses:When a Toreador experiences something truly remarkable — a person, an objet d’art, alovely sunrise — the player must make a Self-Controlor Instincts roll (difficulty 6). Failure means that theKindred finds herself enthralled by the experience. Thedazzled Toreador cannot act for the duration of thescene aside from commenting on or continuing theirinvolvement with whatever has captured their attention. If the experience no longer affects her (whetherby moving, being destroyed, or whatever is appropriate to the situation), the captivation ends. EnrapturedToreador may not even defend themselves if attacked,though being wounded allows them to make anotherSelf-Control or Instincts roll.

	Organization:Clan Toreador is cliquish and parochial in its local domains, but very rarely on a level thataffects Clan-wide custom. Certain Toreador (and a fewoutside the Clan) sometimes use the terms “artiste” and “poseur” when describing individual Toreador,often derisively, to describe whether the Degeneratein question is one who is seen as creative or simply afollower of established trends, but these are certainlyinformal distinctions.



--Tremere

	*In nights long lost to the passage of time, the Tremere existed, though they were something else. Those earlyTremere then made a bargain — or wrought a spell,or any number of other harrowing methods attributedto the Clan — that changed them from what they hadbeen into the vampires they are tonight. Some claimthey stole the Curse of Caine from a torpid Antediluvian, or that they concocted the flawed immortality of the Kindred from the stolen vitae of other vampires. Such mysterious origins, which some describe astreacherous or even blasphemous, haunt the Tremere,as the other Clans look upon them with mistrust andsuspicion. The history — and, indeed, the modernlegacy — of the Tremere is one marked by Clan war,centuries-old grudges, and the stain of unwholesomemysteries long left unsolved. Tonight, Clan Tremere is a Clan shapedby its practice of blood sorcery. A flexible Discipline, Thaumaturgy is heavily entrenched within the Tremere,and they maintain cultic havensknown as cha
ntries to studyits uses and share secretsamong each other. Tothe Tremere, blood isboth sustenance and thesource of mystical power;they gather in their witchhouses to further their understanding ofthe vitae that is such a focal point of theirunlives.Beyond the practice of Thaumaturgy itself,the Warlocks are known for their close-knit hierarchy. They hail from the Old World, with an established power base in Vienna to which all membersof the Clan answer to some degree. Although theymay be one of the youngest Clans — in the termswith which deathless creatures like vampires measuretime — they are as adept at the Jyhad as any Kindred.Beset by enemies who call them usurpers and backedby allies who may or may not defend the alliances theyforce, the Tremere have evolved to be self-sufficient.Indeed, many who eye them warily think they possess too great an edge, with their flexible Disciplineand protective Clan and chantry structure, and moveagainst them both secretly and overtly.

	Nickname:Warlocks

	Background:The Tremere draw from a fairly narrowpool of potential acolytes. Those who have an awareness of the supernatural, who are driven to succeed,who seek answers that elude less inquisitive individuals, yet who also have the discipline to heed the edictsof the hierarchy make good Tremere. This isn’t to saythat individualists don’t have room in the Clan; rather,those who go their own way may well find themselvesleading a chantry — or greeting the sun if their interests don’t align with those of the pyramid.

	Sect:Clan Tremere considers itself one of the pillars of the Camarilla. It is rumored that they once performeda ritual that all but eradicated those ofthe Clan not loyal to the IvoryTower (and thus the Tremere’spyramidal hierarchy).

	Haven:Many Tremere rely on a central chantry theClan maintains in cities where it has a notable presence. More solitary Warlocks develop private havens,with all of the trappings one might expect from an occult scholar, from libraries to alchemical laboratories tomoonlit balcony observatories and even more sinisteroubliettes where vivisected “research subjects” bleedaccording to experimental Tremere-controlled stimuli.

	Appearance:Tremere oftenhave two distinct presentations: a traditional and severe public aspect and amuch more eldritch mienbetter suited to wielding theirblood sorceries. When outin public or at Kindredevents, the Tremere favor conservative suits anddresses and muted tones.When in their chantriesor convening with others of their Clan,they often prefer robesdecorated with subtle occult symbols or garbwith various folds andpockets for their bizarreritual ingredients.

	Character Creation:Mental Attributes and Knowledges are prominent among the Tremere. Many havehigh Courage and Willpower, but are somewhat lackingin Conscience or Conviction. They often favor Backgrounds that heighten their relationship to the Clan, likeMentor, Status, and Retainers (whom an accomplishedWarlock may craft from otherwise inert components).

	Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Dominate, Thaumaturgy

	Weaknesses:Tremere dependency on blood is evenmore pronounced than that of other Kindred. It takesonly two draughts of another vampire’s blood for aTremere to become blood bound instead of the normalthree — the first drink counts as if the Tremere had takentwo drinks. (For more information on the blood bond, seep. 286). The elders of the Clan are well aware of this, andseek to impart loyalty to the Clan by forcing all neonateWarlocks to drink of the (transubstantiated) blood of theseven Tremere elders soon after their Embrace.

	Organization:The hallmark of Clan Tremere is “the pyramid,” the rigid hierarchy that governs the Clanand makes it the most organized of all the Kindredlineages. With many levels of membership, internalfactions, and circles of mystery, the Tremere hierarchypresents a unified face to those outside the Clan, andis almost as unified behind the scenes. Still, the pyramid inculcates more than its share of paranoia, as bothQuote: When the world refusesto give, he who makes himself amaster of the world may still take. rogue Warlocks and a competitive environment of academic occultism pits each acolyte against her peers tothe greater accomplishment of the Clan.



--Tzimisce

	*A blood moon casts a crimson light over the landbeyond the forest and something fearsome howls its agony into the night. The Tzimisce call these lands theirancestral home. Since time out of mind the Fiendshave been masters and lords of the domains of much ofEastern Europe. But theirs is a proud, selfish Clan forwhich tradition goes only so far despite their aristocratic origins. In fact, the Clan claims to have destroyedits Antediluvian, and in the wake of that momentousevent, helped establish the foundations of the Sabbat.Tzimisce practice a strange Discipline known as Vicissitude that allows them to twist the skin andbone of their victims. In many cases, theyrefine their fleshly arts by practicing uponthemselves, but they just as frequently useit upon their lackeys and retainers, turningtheir boyars and szlachta into monstrousthralls. Vicissitude itself is a much misunderstood Discipline, and debates overits origins occasionally plunge the Claninto vicious partisan rivalries. Clan
 Tzimisce is a Clan of extremes, andlong, cold nights spent in remote castles haveturned the Fiends’ perspectives both greatlyinward and outward. Mystics of the Clan studya philosophy of metamorphosis, seeking to discover what lies beyond the state of vampirism.An alien attitude of spiritual secularism characterizes many Tzimisce. Young members of the Clanoften find themselves detached from the historicalrole of the Fiends as terrifying landed lords, andthrow themselves wholly into a cause of their ownchoice, whether as Sabbat zealots, fleshcraftedhorrors, or transcendental koldun sorcerers.

	Nickname:Fiends

	Background:Elder Tzimisce, particularly those ofthe still-landed nobility in hoary old domains, mayhave family lines from which they Embrace, or theymay restrict their occasional siring to the terrified villages suffering in thrall beneath their estates. NewWorld and younger Tzimisce aren’t as discriminatingand are more practical. Indeed, many Tzimisce fledglings are little more than shock troops, Embraced andwarped to the limits of their frames to cause revulsionand revel in bloodshed until put down.

	Sect:The Tzimisce are longtime but largely detached members of the Sabbat. They were instrumental in the Sect’s nascence, and remain oneof its most numerous Clans.

	Haven:YoungTzimisceare often Sabbat Priests orDucti, and prefer to maintain communal havens with theirpacks. They encourage the pack to live in fearsome locations, such as beneath a hospital or morgue, or in the dankrecesses of a mausoleum. Elders of the Clan sometimeshave ancestral holdings in the Old World, and the imageof the vampire on the craggy mountain in a crumblingcastle owes much to Tzimisce lords. Rarely are these ancient holdings kept to any modern standards of comfort,but their lords are strangely hospitable to invited guests(and terribly intolerant of uninvited bores).

	Appearance:Given their ability to manipulate theirphysical appearance with Vicissitude, Tzimisce look however they want, and they often want to provoke orfrighten. Some prefer extreme modifications and experimentations with their bodies that leave them lookingonly vaguely humanoid. Others seek to redefine and eventranscend the limits of their forms, rebuilding themselves in the images ofangels, monsters,nightmares,and thingseven lessrecognizable.

	Character Creation:Few Tzimisce know moderation, and thus often favor Physical or Mental Attributes, usually with one extraordinarily high Trait.Knowledges are usually favored, though Skills are valued as well. Mentor, Allies, Domain, and Retainers areall quite appropriate to Tzimisce, as are narrow — almost overdeveloped — Disciplines. Their alien mindsets often lead them to follow Paths of Enlightenment.The ghastliness to which many Tzimisce are often exposed during their fledgling years sometimes results incomplicated derangements.

	Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Auspex, Vicissitude

	Weaknesses:The Tzimisce are inextricably tied totheir domains of origin, and must rest in the proximityof at least two handfuls of “native soil” — earth from aplace important to her as a mortal, such as the soil fromher birthplace or the graveyard where she underwenther Embrace. Each night spent without this physicalconnection to her land limits all of the Tzimisce’s dicepools to one-half, cumulatively, until she has only asingle die in her pool. The penalty remains until sherests for a full day amid her earth once more.

	Organization:The Fiends are, on the whole, mistrustful of other Kindred, especially others of their own Clan.As such, Tzimisce organization, such as it is, has a highregard for solitude. It is against their nature to be inclu- sive, and thus they have to work at being Sabbat (thoughthis is less difficult for younger Tzimisce of at least somewhat modern outlooks). This is also a key reason so manyof them undertake Paths of Enlightenment: to give theirxenophobia purpose, but also to provide some commonpoint of reference with others on the Path.



--Ventrue

	*Throughout history, while the other Clans have skulked about their petty intrigues, the Ventrue havecurried favor with Caesar, whispered into the ear ofCharlemagne, bankrolled the Age of Exploration, andeven swayed policy in the Holy See. Theirsis a legacy of rulership, from Ventrue fledglings starting theirclimb to the top to the mightiest elders whose influencespans the world. Long havethey played kingmaker in theshadows in the mortal world, andlong have they been the Clan ofKings among the Kindred.Other Clans, of course, find all thisinsufferably pompous at best,punishably tedious at worst.Someone has to lead,surely, but why does italways have to be somelong-winded, self-aggrandizing Ventrue?The Blue Bloods tryto bear the criticismof their lessers witha sense of noblesseoblige — everheavy hangs thathead that wearsthe crown — buteven the most munificent of Kindredleaders occasionally succumbsto tyranny and bloody rage. Tonight, the Ventrue are asynthesis of the modern andthe a
ncient, often in starkcontrast within the Clan andamong one another. Theirs ismoney of old, from the vaultsof Croesus, but their young manipulate stock markets and influence currencies. Elders may command armies or even wholegovernments, while neonates conjure their assets froma website or smartphone app. But for all their wealth,their distinguished history, and their status among theDamned, each and every Ventrue must still seek thatone resource that makes Kindred society egalitarian:precious blood.

	Nickname:Blue Bloods

	Background:Anyone who has “made something ofherself” may attract the attention of the Ventrue, whojudge their childer based on their prominence and success even before they start to groom them for the Embrace. Socialites, moneyed family, corporate wunderkinds,military leaders, and even untested newcomers who showgreat promise are keenly valued among the Blue Bloods.

	Sect:To hear the Ventrue tell it, the very ideaof the Camarilla originated with them. Every otherClan realized what an invaluable proposition it wasand flocked to their banner.

	Haven:A Ventrue’s havendisplays both her great power(read: wealth) and distinguishedtastes. Opulent, grandiose, evenbaroque — these may all apply toVentrue havens. They shun thegaudy displays of other Kindred,and their style tends less to theavant-garde than it does to theclassical and traditional. To theBlue Bloods, a well-maintained haven is an extension of oneself, and for someone tosee it in less than flawless state implies weakness, distraction, or even madness.

	Appearance:The Ventrue favor conservativeclothing and reserved presentation, unlessthey’re making a point about poweror money. Ventrue Princes maywell wear a circlet or carry ascepter as symbols of office,while young Blue Bloodsdisplay their own achievement via suits, ties, dresses,and accessories that are easily overlooked singularlybut add up to a stunning total effect. If a Ventrue has somuch as a hair out of place,it’s because he spent all nightrunning down the Society ofLeopold and demanding theSabbat menace retreat.

	Character Creation:Ventrue usually have directorialor outgoing personality archetypes. Members of ClanVentrue favor Social and Mental Attributes, but anyAbility category can be primary, reflecting a personal avenue of expertise. Backgrounds go both wide and deepfor the Ventrue, with almost every Blue Blood possessingsome amount of Resources, Status, and Herd (particularly the latter, given the Clan weakness). Elders in particular cultivate enviable havens and sprawling Domains.

	Clan Disciplines: Dominate, Fortitude, Presence

	Weaknesses:The Ventrue have rarified tastes, andthey find only one specific type of mortal blood palatable and vital for them. When a player creates a Ventrue character, he should decide with the Storytellerwhat specific type of blood suits the character, and thischoice is permanent. Blood of other types (even animals) simply offers the vampire no blood pool increase,no matter how much he consumes — he simply vomitsit back up. This refined palate may be very narrow orvery broad — say, the blood of younger sisters, or theblood of nude children. Vampiric blood is exempt fromthis restriction.

	Organization:The Clan-wide organization of theVentrue is localized and feudal, with various universally understood peerages, vassalages, oaths of fealty, andsworn boons taking the place of a rigid hierarchy. ManyVentrue style themselves as secret masters of their domains, consolidating power in longstanding networksand forming conspiracies. The Ventrue greatly valuepropriety and honor, and use many forms of addressand respect — their Laws of Decorum are complexand rigid, and could fill several volumes. Almost everyVentrue worth his status can recite his lineage at leastback to the elders, if not to the great Methuselahs.



--Baali

	*Even monsters have their bogeymen, and Kindredare no exception. Sires often attempt to keep neonatesfrom growing drunk on their own power as vampires,and one method for doing so is to explain to them whatsorts of twisted, evil power awaits them in the dark.The Baali are one such power. History — or legend, perhaps — claims that the childe of an Antediluvian made a pact with forces beyondhuman understanding in order to make war on thethirteen Clans. He took the name Baal-the-Destroyer,and he led his apostles against the Second City. Thebattle was terrible, and none caught in its wake werespared — Demon and Kindred alike perished. But theBaali and their unholy allies were routed and fled, andover the millennia, they faded from memory, to legend, to cautionary tale.The Baali do still exist, though. The Inquisitionweeded out the stupid and the careless, but left theclever and the patient. Some went into torpor, whileothers simply claimed membership in another Clanand begged for sa
nctuary. Now, in modern nights, thebloodline sees more concentrated activity than it hasfor centuries. Baali are explorers and seekers of secrets.They will do almost anything and sacrifice almost anyone to gain access to occult mysteries. They squanderthe wealth they have accumulated, they make dealsthey cannot possible hope to live up to, and theydo so with no apology and no attempt at excuse.They seem to know that they are in decline, andthat their bloodline is disappearing into the mistsof time.The bloodline has enemies, after all. Infernalists — those who call up and worship demons —are one of the very few beings that can be called“common enemies” by most of the denizens of theWorld of Darkness, Kindred and otherwise.Despite their small numbers and host of enemies, the Baali are dangerous. They are notFaustian bargainers, looking for comfort or evenknowledge. They do not wish to reign in Hell.They believe — they know — that the world isdoomed. The End Times are here, a
nd every sacrifice they make, every murder they incite, is onemore chink in the dam holding back the deluge ofblood called Gehenna. If they have to die to breakthat dam, so be it. They die knowing that what theydo is what must be done.

	Nickname:Demons

	Background:The Baali value temperament aboveprofession. Teachers, defrocked priests, laborers, artists— all have joined the ranks of the Baali. The bloodlineeven breeds their own recruits, drawing from ghoul families raised over the years to produce offspring suckledon the unholy truths that the Baali recite as gospel.

	Sect:While individual Baali might pretend tomembership in the Camarilla or, less commonly, theSabbat, the bloodline as a whole claims no Sect.

	Haven:Baali tend to nest in places of antiquity. Libraries, universities, and stately homes attract the Demons. No matter where the Baali make their havens,though, the vampire’s very presence changes the place.Vermin creep in first, and no amount of effort can keepthem out.

	Appearance:Some neonates adorn themselves withSatanic paraphernalia. Some Baali dress in expensiveclothing, and some don’t bother. Some become so fixated that they neglect outer appearance. Older Baalisurround themselves with insects, rats, or other vermin.

	Character Creation:Mental Attributes, especiallyPerception, are usually primary. A Baali’s ability totempt and entice depend on his insight into what aperson truly wants. Social Attributes are also helpful,as the Baali need both to keep their identities a secretand convince others to open up to them.

	Clan Disciplines: Daimoinon, Obfuscate, Presence

	Weaknesses:Baali cannot bear to look upon or handle objects of any faith. Demons must avert their gazesfrom such objects, and touching them burns their flesh.In addition, should a Baali run afoul of True Faith, anyhindering or damage effects are doubled.

	Organization:The Baali gather in cabals numbering three to 13. Supposedly, these cabals answer to thebloodline’s founder. Any Demon is willing to die toprotect his cabal-mates; not out of any loyalty or affection for them, but because they’re all doomed anyway.



--Blood Brothers

	*The Blood Brothers are Kindred only in a veryloose sense. They are Sabbat shock troops, created byTremere and Tzimisce sorcerers in order for the Swordof Caine to have loyal soldiers that can still pass forhuman. The process of creation (for the Blood Brothers do not undergo an Embrace) washes away any individuality and personality, leaving only strong, savage,and near-mindless quasi-vampires. Blood Brothers are usually created in small groups ofthree to 10. These groups — called “circles” — becomefamily units connected by a kind of hive mind. TheSabbat also usually arranges for a Tzimisce to fleshcraftthe circle’s faces so that they are identical.The Frankensteins are a secret weapon for the Sabbat for several reasons. The Sabbat finds that whilethe loyalty of the Blood Brothers is beyond reproach,they don’t possess much in the way of creativity. Theyaren’t capable of trickery, clever tactics, or improvisation, and unless another vampire can direct them in the field i
n real time (whichisn’t impossible, given modern communication technology), they aren’t goodfor much beyond simple, direct missions.Second, they are difficult and risky tocreate. Creating a circle of Blood Brothers means killing half a dozen people.While the Sabbat doesn’t have aproblem with that in itself, a patternof disappearances can clue in mortalauthorities and Camarilla watchersalike that the Sword of Caine is up tosomething.Finally, the Blood Brothers are moreuseful as a surprise attack, and survivorsof those attacks run the risk of passing along knowledge of the Brothers’weaknesses. Creating too many, evenif it were possible or practical, wouldmean that eventually some Camarilla Tremere would figure out howto hurt them, or even how to reverse the magic that keeps themmindless, loyal, and useful. Somerumors say that this has alreadyhappened, but that the Tremerearen’t willing to share this knowledge with the Camarilla just yet.

	Nickname:Frankensteins

	Background:A Blood Brother’s mortal life is irrelevant. All that a person needs to do to become a BloodBrother is cross the wrong vampire’s path on the wrongnight. The Sabbat kills the target, removes his bodyhair, smooths over his features, and places him withfour or five others, and after that no trace of the manthat-was remains.

	Sect:The Blood Brothers belong to the Sabbat exclusively. A Blood Brother that comes through thecreation process with his individuality intact is destroyed.

	Haven:Blood Brothers stay in whatever haven isprovided for them by the Sabbat. As long as the circleis allowed to stay together, they don’t seem to caremuch about amenities.

	Appearance:A Blood Brother often looks identicalto the others in his circle, barring any burns or othermarks that he might have picked up in battle. Theyusually dress alike. The members of the circle grow agitated when they see each other as “different.”

	Character Creation:Blood Brothers prioritize Physical Attributes and Talents. Nature and Demeanor areusually the same; common choices are Conformist,Bravo, and Monster. Blood Brothers don’t usually havemuch in the way of Backgrounds apart from Generation and Mentor (their handler or creator).

	Clan Disciplines: Fortitude, Potence, Sanguinus

	Weaknesses:Blood Brothers cannot Embrace. If theyattempt it, the mortal simply dies.In addition, the Frankensteins literally feel each other’s pain. When a Blood Brother suffers a wound penalty, all members of the circle suffer the same penaltyfor the next turn. If two Blood Brothers are wounded,only the greater wound penalty applies. Blood Brothers do not continually suffer these penalties unless one ofthem suffers a new wound.

	Organization:The bloodline as a whole has no organization. It is loyal to the Sabbat, and the membersare otherwise loyal to their circles. The Blood Brotherstreat their handlers with complete loyalty, borderingon sycophancy. They treat other Sabbat Kindred withquiet deference.



--Daughters of Cacophony

	*The Daughters of Cacophony emerged as a distinctbloodline sometime during the 19th century. Beforethat, of course, there were always Kindred who sawmusic and song as a way to remain sane. Kindred scholars believe that the Daughters sprang from the blood ofeither Clan Toreador (for their passionate artistic pursuit) or Malkavian (given their propensity for causingmadness), but their supernatural powers point moretoward Clan Ventrue. It’s something of a moot point,as the “first” Daughter of Cacophonyis unknown. Regardless of theirorigins, the Sirens (as they arecalled in Kindred circles) areall singers, and the bloodline has always been predominantly female. Indeed, the Daughters of Cacophony base theirunlives on song. They wander through eternity withmusic always in their ears, and that makes them seemunfocused or flighty to other Kindred. This is one ofthe reasons, along with their rarity, that neither majorSect of vampires considers them a threat or much morethan a diversion.
 Individual Kindred, however, mighthave occasion to meet a Siren and wonder why it isthat those who spend too much time listening to theirsongs always seemed changed by the experience.

	Nickname:Sirens

	Background:The majority of Sirens were singersbefore the Embrace as well. Very occasionally, aDaughter Embraces someone who never developedher skill at singing, but these discover their talentsswiftly.The Daughters do not discriminate based on musical style. Jazz singer, nu-metal waif, opera diva, sultrylounge performer — any chanteuse might be a Siren.

	Sect:Sirens might fall in with whichever Sect holdspower locally. If asked, most Daughters either identifyas independents or claim membership in the Camarilla.

	Haven:Most Sirens have a quiet room with goodacoustics where they can sing without anyone listening. As much as most Daughters love performing, theywould prefer to be alone after the “show” ends, and sothe outward appearance of their havens isn’t as important as maintaining its secrecy.

	Appearance:A Siren might be a street musiciandressed in thrift-store chic, a pierced and tattooedpunk rocker, or a high-class entertainer with moneyand prestige. Apart from the fact that the Daughtersare largely female, their appearance varies widely.

	Character Creation:Social Attributes tend to beprimary. Expression and Performance are almost always high, and many have Fame. Sirens who diewith a following reap the benefit of their fans(Herd). Those less lucky often still have Contacts in show business.

	Clan Disciplines: Fortitude, Melpominee, Presence

	Weaknesses:The Daughters of Cacophonyhear music constantly. This might be a formof synesthesia, or it might be a hallucination. This constant song distracts the Daughters as much asit guides them. The difficulties of all their Perceptionrolls increase by two. No Daughter of Cacophony mayhave Alertness above 3 dots.

	Organization:Their numbers are too small for themto be truly organized, yet sometimes the Sirens act asone. Every so often, Sirens everywhere put on a performance on the same night. They don’t necessarily singthe same songs, but all of the waking Sirens sing atexactly the same time.



--Gargoyles

	*The Tremere unveiled the Gargoyle bloodline in AD 1167, and the Slaves have been a steady, if infrequent, part of Kindred society ever since. Gargoylesmight, in fact, be one reason that the Tremere weren’texterminated entirely in their first few centuries ofexistence. These odd quasi-Kindred often look liketheir stone namesakes — rocky-skinned, ugly,winged creatures that exist only to servetheir masters. Or such was the case for several hundred years. Recently,though, many of the Slaveshave thrown off theirchains and joined theCamarilla. Why theGargoyles chooseto ally themselves with theSect that alsoprotects theirformer masters is anyone’sguess. One ofthe going theoriesis that it’s a slap in the Warlocks’ collective face, but most Kindred don’t givethe Gargoyles credit for being that sophisticated. More likely, the Rockheads simplyrealize that in the Camarilla, their talents will be recognized and no one will try and order them around (atleast not directly).Gargoyles ar
e created out of other Kindred, and thisugly fact makes their creation a seldom-discussedtopic in polite vampiric society. The Tremerestart with a Gangrel, Nosferatu, or Tzimiscevampire and perform obscene, bloody ritualsusing its blood, heart, and skin. Vitae fromanother vampire (from one of the other twoClans) is used to provoke a violent mutation,with the result that some Gargoyles look purelyhideous (Nosferatu base), some look feral (Gangrel base), and some look fleshy and sport bony protrusions (Tzimisce base). No Gargoyle can pass forhuman.The Tremere tolerate the Gargoyles’ presence in theCamarilla as best they can — it’s not as though theycan easily re-enslave them, after all. But relations are obviously strained. The Gargoyles’ revolt and induction into the Camarilla has all but doomed the remaining slave Gargoyles, as their masters now monitor them ruthlessly for any sign of betrayal. The Tremerealso aren’t above planting hypnotic suggestions in their Slaves’ min
ds, so that if they ever do rebel, they still serve a function for the Clan.

	Nickname:Traditionally Slaves, though free Gargoyles have been known to crack heads over it. Othercommon nicknames are Rockheads, Runaways, Freemen, and Grotesques.

	Background:Gargoyles creation rarelyshows a discernible pattern. The Changetortures the new Gargoyle’s body, as boneselongate and split to form the wings. The facewarps, leaving nothing to recognize the mortalor vampire by. They rarely remember their unlife or mortal existence.

	Sect:Gargoyles usually join the Camarilla. It’s not impossible for a Slave to join the Sabbat, but thebloodline as a whole frowns on this.

	Haven:Slave Gargoyles sleep wherever theirmasters allow them — closets, basements, crypts,cells. Free Gargoyles prefer sleeping in havenshigh above the ground. Bell towers and disusedhigh-rises are favorites. Gargoyles are oftenmuscle for other Kindred, sometimes in exchange for a bare-bones haven.

	Appearance:Not all Gargoyles look like the stonegrotesques found spitting rainwater over old buildings,but all are nightmarish. Some have tufts of hair protruding randomly over their bodies, or odd, gallopingwalks. Most Gargoyles have gray, rock-like skin. AllGargoyles have wings. These grow as the character’sFlight (see p. 447) increases.

	Character Creation:Created to be slaves,Gargoyles specialize in Physical Attributes, Talents, and a few select Skills (Melee, for instance).All Gargoyles start with a free dot of the FlightDiscipline. Appearance is always zero. Gargoylescreated by the Tremere are at the same Generationas the Kindred that act as their “base.”

	Clan Disciplines: Flight, Fortitude, Potence, Visceratika

	Weaknesses:The Slaves are hideous. That grotesquerytakes different forms, but always results in an Appearance of zero. They are also highly susceptible to mindcontrol from any source. A Gargoyle’s Willpower score(current or permanent) is considered two points lowerwhen used to resist such powers.

	Organization:Gargoyles have a strong sense of community. They often keep communal havens. Sometimes Gargoyles petition the Prince for the release ofslave Gargoyles, but more often they just tear slaveowners to pieces. With no community, Gargoyles arelikely to Embrace and build their own.



--Harbingers of Skulls

	*The Harbingers of Skulls are a small bloodline thatemerged from the mists of the past and threw their lotin with the Sabbat. The Harbingers are alleged to all beelders, and frighteningly powerful. While their suddenappearance suggests a long bout of torpor, they don’tbehave like recently-awakened vampires. Indeed, theyclaim they have been dead these past five centuries.The Harbingers of Skulls resemble rotting corpses,much like the Samedi. Indeed, vampires that know ofboth bloodlines suggest a common origin, but sinceneither the Samedi nor the Harbingers discuss theirorigins publically, it’s just speculation. The Harbingers have only been members of the Sabbat for a short time, but during that time they havemade themselves invaluable. The Sword of Caine,lacking Giovanni members, has difficulty dealing withghosts. This can lead to problematic hauntings, sincethe Sabbat kills enough people that ghostly visitationcan become an issue. The Harbingers can exorcisesthese vengeful shade
s, or, better yet, turn them intoincorporeal spies and slaves. And for all of this, theHarbingers ask nothing except for favors to be repaid at a later date.The Sabbat, for its part, isn’t usually givento the favor-trading that one finds in the Camarilla, but what the Harbingers bring to thetable is too valuable to miss. And besides,whether one believes the fairy tale aboutnoble origins and “revenge on the traitorousmoneylenders” that the Harbingers sometimesspin, their passion is palpable. That kind ofmurderous zeal is always welcome in the Swordof Caine.

	Nickname:Lazarenes

	Background:The background of a “typical” Harbinger is impossible to know. They are all elders, and whothey were in life has been lost to time. They do seem toshow evidence of a classical education, and one survivor of a battle between a Harbinger and a gang of Camarilla Brujah mentions that the Lazarene used a styleof fighting that originated in Florence. Beyond thosesparse clues, however, the Harbingers’ true identitiesare unknown.

	Sect:The Harbingers of Skulls belong entirelyto the Sabbat. That said, given that the bloodlineobviously has many secrets buried, it’s impossibleto know if any Lazarenes claim membership in theCamarilla or remain independent.

	Haven:Unlike most Sabbat Kindred, the Harbingers of Skulls do not join packs, and therefore do notuse communal havens. They usually choose lairs awayfrom mortal interference, but close enough to the living that they don’t want for blood (or fresh corpses for their horrific arts). Crypts, disused laboratories, andslaughterhouses are common choices.

	Appearance:The Harbingers prefer to stay hiddenin their havens, or at least remain among Kindred,and for good reason. They resemble emaciated,shrunken corpses. Their skin grows taut and white,and the gums recede, giving the impression of ableached, grinning skull. Most Harbingers wearing flowing garments or burial shrouds, the better tohighlight their affinity for death.

	Character Creation:The Harbingers of Skulls tendtoward morbid and somewhat violent concepts. Theyare obsessed with revenge, death, and the horrors beyond the grave. Social Attributes and Abilities aren’t apriority. Mental Attributes and Knowledges are generally highly rated, but their status as elders means thatthey are formidable across the board (and imply a significant amount spent on the Generation Backgroundto boot).

	Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Fortitude, Necromancy

	Weaknesses:No matter how much blood a Harbingerconsumes, her skin remains deathly pale. Moreover, allHarbingers look like shriveled corpses. They have Appearance ratings of 0 and automatically fail Appearance rolls.

	Organization:The Harbingers have some kind of internal organization, and they do keep in contact andeven meet with one another occasionally. They keepin touch using ghostly messengers, and they travel to meet each other using methods that other Kindred cannot match. Most of the Sabbat doesn’t quite know howmany Harbingers exist or what they might be doing.



--Kiasyd

	*The Kiasyd are a bloodline of the Lasombra Clan;that much is obvious, given that these odd Kindredmake use of the Obtenebration Discipline. But theiraversion to iron, their odd power of Mytherceria, andtheir very appearance speak to even stranger ancestry. The Kiasyd are independent, focused more on theirstudies than on the causes of the Sword of Caine. Theones that do claim membership in the Sabbat aren’tpassionately involved in the Sect’s activities. Somespeculate that the Lasombra hold some power overthem — did the Keepers create the Kiasyd, the way theTzimisce created the Blood Brothers? Do the Kiasyd,whatever their origin, owe the Lasombra some debt?Whatever the nature of their relationship, it seems tobenefit the Sabbat.The Kiasyd are, as a rule, calm and studious. Theyprefer to remain ensconced within their havens, poring over ancient texts, maps, artifacts, and other bitsof antiquity. Other Kindred, it seems, can’t understandhow a lineage of vampires that is so very 
strange couldbe nothing more than scholars. To hear the rumor-milltell it, the Kiasyd can feed only on the blood of infants,or faeries, or unspoiled virgins. Their otherworldly heritage comes not from the Good Folk, but from demonsand the forces of Hell. Their odd appearance isn’t because of mutation in their vitae, but a God-given warning: These are not Kindred. They are other.

	Nickname:Weirdlings

	Background:Museum curators, talented students, librarians, rare book experts, and academics of all stripesare likely choices for Kiasyd Embraces. The Weirdlingswant their progeny to be studious, polite, and educated,and they don’t want to take the time instructing themin the basics of erudite understanding.

	Sect:Most Kiasyd belong to the Sabbat, at leastnominally. A rare few identify as Camarilla vampires,and others are independent. Since the Kiasyd don’tspend much time around each other if they can help it(see below), drawing a conclusion about their collective preferences is difficult.

	Haven:Most Kiasyd spend years building up theirhavens, improving security, library facilities, and otheramenities. They are fiercely protective of their homes,and they do not allow guests without explicit invitations. When they do invite guests, however, they treatthem well, offering vintage vitae, comfortable roomsand, of course, plenty of reading material.

	Appearance:The Kiasyd aren’t called “Weirdlings”just because of their behavior. Most of them are wellover six feet tall (two meters or more), willowy, andthin. Their skin isn’t just pale, as with most vampires,but glows faintly in moonlight. Their eyes are almondshaped and have no visible pupils. They are often violet or jet black in color. Their ears are slightly pointed.The Kiasyd cover this with a hat or headband whengoing out amongst mortals, but even so, their heightand skin tone make them stand out.

	Character Creation:Mental Attributes and Knowledges are usually primary, though all Kiasyd have somedegree of Etiquette. Occult is, of course, a commonAbility. Resources, Generation, and Contacts (withother Kindred) are the only common Backgrounds. Kiasyd have difficulty mingling with mortals long enoughto gain others.

	Clan Disciplines: Dominate, Mytherceria, Obtenebration

	Weaknesses:Besides their somewhat freakish appearance, Kiasyd also have an allergy to iron. Touchingiron requires an immediate roll to avoid frenzy, and anyweapons made from cold iron inflict aggravated damage to Kiasyd.

	Organization:The Kiasyd don’t enjoy each other’scompany, which is strange, considering how little theyhave in common with everyone else. After a short period of instruction (50 years at the most, and this periodhas grown much shorter in modern nights), a Kiasydchilde is released from her sire’s haven and is no longerthe elder Kiasyd’s responsibility.



--Nagaraja

	*A bizarre bloodline of flesh-eating witches, the Nagaraja are legends, feared by Kindred on all sides of theJyhad. As a result of their hideous appetites, the Nagaraja have been hunted to near extinction in the modern nights by political enemies and the ghosts uponwhom they prey. A few of these vampires still prowlthe darkness, however, continuing their subtle plans.Although not particularly forthcoming with theirorigins, the Nagaraja supposedly hail from theMiddle East. They are associated witha death cult in that region that ritually consumed human flesh and openedgateways into the lands of the dead.How these cultists became vampires islost to history, but those few Kindredthat have met the Nagaraja havetheories: maybe a wandering Giovanni trader Embraced them, perhapsthey tried to follow in Tremere’sfootsteps, or they could be the lastsurviving Cappadocians. The Nagaraja refuse to confirm or denysuch speculations, however,so the truth and rumorcontinue to entwinearound these my
sterious Kindred. Some of the Flesh Eaters belong to a Sectof vampires calledthe Tal’Mahe’Ra orthe “True Black Hand,” apparently distinctfrom the Black Hand of the Sabbat. Whatthe Tal’Mahe’Ra is doing in the Deadlandsisn’t clear, nor why they war with the Restless Dead, but their city in the Underworld ishome to a number of the Nagaraja. Thosein the land of the living are independent,now seeking to eke out whatever unlifethey can.

	Nickname:Flesh-Eaters

	Background:Most Nagaraja are well-educated, andmany have some medicalknowledge (either fromtheir mortal lives or acquired post-Embrace). Thebloodline’s small numbersmake further assertions difficult to support. Some Nagaraja were priests or cultistsbefore the Embrace, someantiquarians, and some exorcists or ghost-hunters.

	Sect:The Nagaraja as a wholerefuse membership in either theCamarilla or the Sabbat, but inCamarilla cities they follow therules as well as they can (giventheir weakness).

	Haven:The Nagaraja take havens where they can.One thing that the Flesh-Eaters do try to incorporateinto their havens, when they can, is a means for disposing of bodies. They do not have the luxury ofmerely sipping a bit of blood the wayother Kindred do.

	Appearance:Nagaraja have pointed, irregular teeth,rather than the usual retractable fangs. This meansthat they seldom smile, and they tend to speak quietlyaround mortals — unless they plan to eat them.

	Character Creation:Nagaraja usually have solitary orselfish concepts and Natures,though their Demeanors maybe practically anything. Mental Attributes are usually primary, as are Knowledges. Themost common Backgroundsfor Nagaraja are Contacts,Resources, and Retainers,though a few twisted Mentorssometimes Embrace childer.

	Clan Disciplines:Auspex, Dominate, Necromancy

	Weaknesses:The Nagaraja requireraw flesh in addition to blood to survive. For every night a Nagarajagoes without consuming flesh, he loses one cumulativedie from all his Physical dice pools. Eating one pointworth of flesh restores one die to these pools until thevampire has “caught up.” A human body has 10 “fleshpoints,” which work just like blood points: A Nagaraja consuming one flesh point increases his blood poolby one. Unlike blood points, however, taking a “fleshpoint” from a vessel does one health level of unsoakable lethal damage to that vessel. The flesh the Nagaraja consume must be relatively fresh, though not necessarily “alive.” Indeed, some Nagaraja keep stores ofritually preserved corpses in their havens. This weakness does not allow them to eat food or consume otherliquids.

	Organization:While some claim this bloodlinebelongs to the Tal’Mahe’Ra in its entirety, there areample exceptions. A given Nagaraja might keep contact with another, but the bloodline as a whole has noorganization.



--Salubri

	*The Salubri were once a true Clan. Their Clanfounder, Saulot, was said to be a superlative warrioras well as a fair-minded judge. It was also said that hegrew progressively more disgusted with Kindred affairsover time, and weary of the constant, bloody cycles ofviolence and betrayal. He left his home for lands far tothe east. When he returned, he was changed. He wastranquil and contemplative, but also somewhat fatalistic. Most surprisingly, though, he had developed a thirdeye in his forehead. Saulot Embraced new childer, andhis Clan slowly split into two distinct lines — the “warrior” and “healer” Salubri. For centuries, they acted asadvisors, bodyguards, and sages to other Kindred and,to a lesser extent, mortals. And then came the diablerie of Saulot.The mages of the newly created Tremere line foundSaulot’s torpid body, and drained his blood and soul.They usurped the power of the one of the Clans ofCaine, and sent the Salubri into a downward spiral fromwhich they never 
really recovered. Tonight, rumor hasit that only seven members of the once-respected lineexist at any given time.The rumors die hard, however. Modern Kindredknow of the Salubri as diablerists who consume theirown sires (and do it openly — patricide is hardly unknown among the other Clans, but they don’t admit toit) and remove the souls of other Kindred. The Soulsuckers are, supposedly, a Clan of defilers and liars fromcenturies past, possibly involved with demon worship,and demonstrably part of the Sabbat (see Salubri antitribu, p. 431). They ask, quite reasonably, how theSalubri are able to achieve Golconda with any regularity. They wonder how any line can sustain itself withso few members. And, finally, they pose this question:even if these first two notions are taken as given, whywould the Salubri need to submit to diablerie? Why dotheir childer need to consume their sires’ souls, if notfor some defect in the bloodline itself?

	Nickname:Cyclops, or, less kindly, Soulsuckers

	Background:The Salubri Embrace people whomthey feel can find Golconda. Healers, teachers, empaths, and other people with high Humanity ratingsare good choices, although occasionally Salubri Embrace evil people in hopes of seeing them redeemed(or, at least, setting them on that path).

	Sect:The Salubri are independent, though they dosometimes masquerade as other Clans and blend inwith the Camarilla. The Salubri, however, are just trying to survive long enough to reach Golconda and passalong their blood. Sectarian politics mean nothing tothem.

	Haven:Salubri are unwelcome in most cities, andthat means their havens are situated in isolated environments. They also usually have multiple escaperoutes, and only have what possessions the charactercan carry in a backpack. Quick departures are not uncommon for the members of this bloodline, so Salubridon’t get attached to their havens.

	Appearance:Each Salubri has a third eye in the center of their forehead. Otherwise, the Salubri are toofew in number for any generalization about their appearances to be possible. Their ranks in modern nightshave included children, the elderly, and adults of allraces.

	Character Creation:Social or Mental Attributes areoften primary, as are Knowledges. Most Salubri alsohave decent ratings in Empathy. All Salubri must takefive dots of Generation (to represent their diablerie oftheir sires), and most have at least a dot of Herd aswell.

	Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Fortitude, Obeah

	Weaknesses:Salubri have difficulty feeding on unwilling vessels. If a Cyclops attempts it, she loses a pointof Willpower.

	Organization:The Salubri are not, as a bloodline,organized. In fact, when Salubri do meet, it tends tobe on the instruction of their sires — the dying wish of a given Cyclops to her childe might be to seek outanother member of the bloodline and deliver a messageor pay respects.



--Samedi

	*If the Nosferatu are repulsive and the Harbingers of Skulls are hideous, a word hasn’t yet been invented todescribe the Samedi. Resembling nothing so much aswalking, rotting corpses, these odd vampires take theirname and their origin from the Caribbean and the religion of vodoun (popularly known as voodoo). Baron Samedi, in legend, was a loa of death and ancestor worship. The vampires that bear his name and visage (forSamedi is often portrayed as a corpse, albeit not oneso disgusting as the Stiffs) also often share his rude,blunt demeanor. In fact, a vampire going by the nameof “Baron Samedi” seems to be the founder, or at leastthe oldest extant member, of the bloodline.The Samedi might seem to be an offshoot of theNosferatu, but their powers of Thanatosis — a Discipline dedicated to manipulating dead flesh — speak ofa connection to the Giovanni or their doomed predecessors, the Cappadocians. If that is the case, though,the Samedi and the Giovanni went their separate waysl
ong ago, for neither has anything good to say aboutthe other. The reason for this enmity is not somethingthat members of either line discuss in public, but theGiovanni apparently have a history with Baron Samedi himself. The Baron, still active in the bloodline’saffairs, refuses to discuss the “deal” that he had withAugustus Giovanni, but it must have been somethingof gravity for the mutual dislike to persist.Samedi take the roles of enforcers and assassinsin Kindred society. They don’t do it on ideological grounds, like the Assamites, and thus they findwork with Kindred who wantto get what they paid for.The Samedi do not takecontracts against Nosferatu or, strangely,Giovanni Kindredwithout a heavyfee, speaking to someregard or fear of theseClans. As with so manyother facts about theirline, the Samedi have nothing to say on the matter.

	Nickname:Stiffs

	Background:The Samedi are a relatively youngline. No Samedi older than 250 years is known to exist.Most of the older ones hail from the Caribbean islandsor the southern United States. Neonate Samedi don’talways share this connection to vodoun, but frequentlywere close to death (one way or another) before theEmbrace.

	Sect:Samedi occasionally jointhe Camarilla or the Sabbat, butfor the most part they considerthemselves independent.

	Haven:The Samedi make havens in places wherea moldering corpse and its stench aren’t out of place.Morgues, mortuaries, graveyards, and meat packingplants house the occasional Samedi. Some members ofthe bloodline choose to dwell below ground like theNosferatu, but this does lead to conflict between theStiffs and the Sewer Rats.

	Appearance:Saying that a Samedi resembles a rotting corpse is, sadly, in noway a euphemism. Their flesh is soft andtends to leak fluid if poked too hard. Their ears and noses rot away (but still function normally),and tiny bits of their skin tend to slough off and regrow.Skin retracts from the eyes and teeth, giving them theappearance of grinning skulls, but too much meat clingsto the cranium for them to achieve the cleaner horrorof the Harbingers of Skulls. Some Samedi are leatheryand dry, like unwrapped mummies. These Stiffs stillstink, but their stench is more reminiscent of rottedflowers and old decay than fresh putrescence.

	Character Creation:While Physical Attributes are apriority for those Samedi working as killers and enforcers, many Samedi lean toward Mental Traits. Samedirarely have the Herd or Resources Backgrounds, andtheir standoffish and solitary nature means that Mentor and Allies are equally rare.

	Clan Disciplines: Fortitude, Obfuscate, Thanatosis

	Weaknesses:The Samedi, as mentioned, are putridbeyond words. Samedi characters have Appearanceratings of 0, and automatically fail Appearance rolls.

	Organization:The Samedi are too rare to be organized. They might cross each other’s paths occasionally and trade stories, but no plan or schedules existsfor these meetings, at least as far as anyone outside thebloodline can tell.



--True Brujah

	*The Clan Brujah that most Kindred know in themodern nights is not, according to legend, the truelineage of the Antediluvian known as “Brujah.” Thestrange bloodline known as the True Brujah claim thatBrujah’s childe, Troile, committeddiablerie upon him and stole control of the Clan. Brujah, it issaid, was not the hot-bloodedwarrior/scholar that manyvampires associate with theRabble, but rather a staid,passionless introvert. Why,then, he chose to Embrace amaniac like Troile in the firstplace is a mystery that will likelynever be fully explained.The True Brujahwere never subject toa massive purge as theSalubri or the Cappadocians were, but theydon’t Embrace oftenand never recoveredfrom the theft of theirClan status. Theircity — the Carthageof Kindred myth, inwhich vampires openlyruled over mortals —supposedly died out dueto the treachery of Troile’schilder (though other storiessuggest demonic influence).From there, the bloodlinefaded from history. A fewnotable members of 
thebloodline appear throughout history, but by themodern nights only Kindred historians or thosewho chance to meetthem can speak of theirexistence.Whatever the truthof their origins, theTrue Brujah have remained a small but constant presence in Kindred society. Sometimes theywear their true nature openly, while other times theyclaim membership in other Clans (stating their Clanas “Brujah,” for example, and not bothering to correctthe misapprehension that ensues). Their primary focusis the pursuit of knowledge, and to that end they havemade some strange alliances. The True Brujah occasionally ally with the Followers of Set, and sometimeseven provide services as consultants to the Sabbat inexchange for access to secrets and locations normallyclosed to them.

	Nickname:Sages

	Background:It’s not entirely accurate to say thatthe True Brujah only Embrace academics and scholars, but it’s fairly rare for them to do otherwise. Sagessometimes Embrace out of curiosity or even spite, butfor the most part they choose people whose capacity oflearning and accumulated knowledge will benefit theirsires.

	Sect:The Sages have become more or less independent. They follow the Camarilla’s rules when in theircities, and avoid the Sabbat lest they become pressedinto service or destroyed. While it isn’t impossible for aTrue Brujah to join the Sword of Caine, most of themcan’t summon up the necessary fervor.

	Haven:Some True Brujah maintain multiple havens around the world, which they use as they travelpursuing whatever kind of knowledge they find mostfascinating. Others stay closer to a given city, generally with a centuries-old university or other center oflearning nearby. In either case, their havens tend to beclean, well-maintained, and austere.

	Appearance:In nights past, the True Brujah werepredominantly of Greek or North African descent. Asthe centuries wore on, though, the Sages Embracedprogeny from across Europe and, eventually, the NewWorld. In modern nights, True Brujah tend to dressprofessionally, the better to fit in with the academicsettings they prefer.

	Character Creation:Mental Attributes and Knowledges are usually primary. True Brujah sires instructtheir childer in the basics of Occult and some form ofcombat (it’s just not practical to be unable to fight).Nature and Demeanor are often similar, if not identical, and never anything forceful or passionate. Common Backgrounds include Resources, Contacts, andHerd.

	Clan Disciplines: Potence, Presence, Temporis

	Weaknesses:True Brujah lose much of their emotionalcapacity when they are Embraced, and their ability forsympathy continues to deteriorate as they grow older.All Conscience and Conviction rolls are made at +2difficulty (maximum 10), and ratings in Conscience,Conviction, Humanity, and Paths of Enlightenmentcost double the normal experience costs.

	Organization:While their rarity precludes frequentmeetings, the bloodline comes together twice a century to discuss matters that affect them all. The eldestmembers of the bloodline determine the location andspecific time of the meeting. Outside of these largermeetings, many True Brujah stay in contact via letters,whether handwritten or online.



--Ahrimanes

	*The strange tale of the Ahrimanes begins with a Sabbat Gangrel antitribu named Muricia. Caught betweentwo warring factions of Sabbat Gangrel, she watchedas her packmates were pulled into the conflict andultimately killed. She renounced the Sabbat and theGangrel Clan entirely, now calling herself “anAhrimane,” and called upon shamanic magicto alter herself. How exactly this was accomplished is still a mystery. One theoryis that Muricia was an anomaly evenbefore she attempted her magical working, and had access to powersthat other vampires didn’t. Another (possibly more plausible)theory is that Muricia had helpfrom mortal sorcerers whowere hoping the effectwould spread throughoutthe Kindred of the world,sterilizing them and preventing any new vampiresfrom being created. Regardless of the origin,Muricia found that shewas not able to createchilder or blood bonds.She did, however,retain the ability toturn other Kindred(at least otherGangrel)intowhatevershe had become. She kept the 
animalistic features that shecan gained during her previous unlife, however, and itmay have been her cat-like eyes that lent her bloodlineits nickname.Muricia extended the offered of “becoming Ahrimane” to any female Gangrel who wished it. Shemade it quite clear she was not interested inperforming the process on male Kindred,though the specific reasons for this remainunclear. A few Gangrel joined her, takinghavens in the southern United States andavoid contacting with other Sabbat. The Ahrimanes were never numerous, and althoughthey remained nominally allied with the Sabbat, Muriciamade it quite clear that theywere to be left alone. This isolation may have doomed them,however. In the late 1990s, allcontact with the Cats ceased.Investigators found, sometimelater, that their havens wereempty, and no one has heardfrom them since. Most Sabbatbelieve that the Ahrimaneswere destroyed, but concedethat it is possible that Muricia might have led herline on a spiritual pilgrimage somewhere 
out of the Kindred’sreach.

	Nickname:Cats

	Background:All Ahrimanes were Gangrel beforetheir magical transformation. As such, their Backgrounds varied just as much as the Beasts’. The sort ofGangrel who became an Ahrimane was female, usuallynon-white, and frustrated by the situation in her Sector city.

	Sect:The Ahrimanes were an independent Sect, ormore accurately, a group of independent individuals.They identified more with the Sabbat than the Camarilla, if only because they did not wish to answer to anyelder (expect perhaps Muricia).

	Haven:Muricia was a vampire of some means, andshe purchased houses on the outskirts of several citiesin the American South (in Louisiana, Mississippi, andGeorgia especially). New Ahrimanes could make theirown arrangements or stay in one of these homes.

	Appearance:All Ahrimanes were female, and mostwere either of African American or Native Americandescent (Muricia, apparently, was not partial to Caucasian vampires). Most Ahrimanes never went anywhereunarmed, and dressed to fight. Many Ahrimanes hadanimal features left over from their time as Gangrel.

	Character Creation:All Ahrimanes had at leastthree dots in Mentor, to represent Muricia’s guidance.Combat Abilities and Physical Attributes were common, but this was as much from the Ahrimanes’ Gangrel background as anything else. Likewise, a dot or twoof Protean or Fortitude was common, since Ahrimanesbegan unlife as Gangrel.

	Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Presence, Spiritus

	Weaknesses:An Ahrimanes’ blood was inert. Theywere unable to create childer or blood bonds, and a person consuming Ahrimane blood did not become aghoul.

	Organization:Since all Ahrimanes effectively hadthe same “sire,” they were all beholden to Muricia. Shedid not attempt to control or rule her creations, but didkeep tabs on them and help them develop their powers of Spiritus. The bloodline was fairly tight-knit, asvampire “families” go, and threatening one Ahrimanegenerally meant battling several.



--Anda

	*The Anda were a Gangrel offshoot, created by a Methuselah called Dobrul the Brave. Dobrul, a wandererwith great respect for the Mongol hordes, Embracedseveral of their warriors. These vampires became the spirit warriors of the steppe, following the nomadicMongol tribes and protecting them from outwardthreats.The Anda had intricate rites governing the Embraceof new Kindred. Once a candidate was selected, anyAnda in the area met for a discussion on that candidate’s qualities. The prospective Tartar had to be animpressive warrior, but tempered enough in natureto understand that only by protecting his tribefrom outward supernatural threats could he keepit healthy enough to feed from. Once the decision was made, the prospective sire would wash thecandidate in a river, a ritual funerary bathing in theMongol tradition. He would then drain and Embracethe new vampire.This kind of ritual and observance governed much ofthe Anda’s existence. Long and lonely nights wandering the steppe, eith
er with the Mongols or alone (andthey did wander alone, sometimes even into WesternEurope), the Anda’s Beast was the only company.Small wonder that these Kindred viewed themselves asspiritual warriors, their brutal ethos the only bulwarkagainst madness and depredation.The Anda made war against a variety of foes. Theywould join their nomad tribes against whatever enemies they chose (as far as they could, since not allbattles were fought at night). They also clashed withnative Chinese shapeshifters and vampires, and it wasthis latter group that proved the undoing of the Andain the 14th century. The bloodline’s heyday was thereign of Kublai Khan, and during this time they couldbe found openly celebrating their undead nature inChina. When Kublai died, the Anda fell into decline,and in the modern nights none are known to exist.

	Nickname:Tartars

	Background:The Anda did not Embrace capriciously. They chose their candidates carefully, sincethis choice made a statement about who would protecttheir people. All Anda were skilled horsemen, trackers, warriors, and, to some degree, shamans.

	Sect:Wandering Anda might join a particular vampire’s court, at least for a time, but their irresistiblepush to keep moving prevented them from becomingpermanent fixtures anywhere in Europe. In their ownlands, they watched over Mongol tribes called yasun,parasitically protecting and feeding from the mortals.

	Haven:The Anda dwelled on the steppe, far enoughaway from their yasun to avoid discovery, but closeenough to catch up with them when night fell. Thetruly monstrous or depraved among them did not protect a tribe, but led a solitary unlife, feeding as opportunity permitted. These poor souls typically fell to torpor from hunger, and if any Anda still exist, it is likelyone of these horrors, sleeping buried in somewhere inChina.

	Appearance:The Anda Embraced exclusively fromthe Mongol tribes, so they were short, stocky, and bowlegged from a lifetime of riding. The skin of an Andafaded to an odd brown-yellow following the Embrace.

	Character Creation:Unlife on the steppe was harsh.Physical Attributes were generally primary, with Talents and Skills sharing priority (especially martial ones— all Anda had some facility in Melee, Brawl, andSurvival). All of the Anda’s Disciplines were important, but neonate Anda generally found that learningEarth Meld was a matter of survival.

	Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Fortitude, Protean

	Weaknesses:Like the Gangrel from which they weredescended, Anda gained animal features from frenzying. Unlike the Gangrel, though, Anda gained such afeature once every other frenzy. However, the Anda suffered a further weakness — for each day after the thirdthat an Anda slept within the same one-mile area, alldice pools were halved (to a minimum pool of one).

	Organization:On the night of the new moon, allAnda within a given radius met to discuss the movements of their yasun and what kinds of threats mightrequire their collective attention. The eldest Anda insuch a gathering was called the khan, and all otherswere expected to submit to his authority.



--Cappadocians

	*The story of Clan Cappadocian is tragic, but illustrative of the parasitic cycle of Kindred existence. Nothing lasts forever in vampiric circles, but nothing evertruly dies.The Cappadocians were a Clan that focused on deathand undeath. Their founder, an ancient known simplyas “Cappadocius” (“of Cappadocia”), did not attemptto rule his Clan. He asked only that they continue thesearch for truth and the secrets of life and death. TheClan’s ancestral roots were rumored to be somewherein Asia Minor, but by the end of the Dark Ages theyhad spread throughout Europe. Known as scholars,mystics, and necromancers, the Cappadocians were asfirmly entrenched in the Cainite society of their timeas any of the Clans of the Camarilla are tonight The Graverobbers expanded their knowledge baseby Embracing members of important families or promising scholars. By the 13th century they had inroadsacross Europe, in monasteries, universities, and in thecourts of royalty, but also members and ghouls
 amongthe working classes. Everyone must eventually die,the Cappadocians realized, and every death waspotentially a lesson.Their inclusive attitude may have spelled theClan’s doom. They accepted a Venetian merchant family called the Giovanni (the family’spropensity for summoning up and controllingghosts had as much to do with their Embrace as their skill with finance). Over thefollowing centuries, the Giovanni workedtheir way into the hierarchy of the Clan, until Augustus Giovanni committed diablerieupon Cappadocius. Over the next few centuries, the Giovanni systematically destroyed theremaining Cappadocians. In modern nights, onlysmall remnants survive, such as the Harbingers ofSkulls. The lineage of these remnants is largely unknown.

	Nickname:Graverobbers

	Background:As a general rule, the Cappadocianswere not concerned with ethnicity or nationality whenEmbracing, meaning that it wasn’t uncommon to findMoors, Jews, or even pagans brought into the Clan.The Graverobbers were more inclined to Embrace people with an interest in death. That didn’t necessarilymean causing death (though certainly they Embracedtheir share of soldiers and hunters), but scholars of theafterlife and religion, gravediggers, priests, and hermitsall found their way to Clan Cappadocian.

	Sect:The Cappadocians did not survive longenough to take a side in the Camarilla/Sabbat divide.

	Haven:Cappadocians preferred a measure of solitudewhen choosing their havens. Although they had to stayclose enough to mortals to feed, they often chose quiet locales to make their homes — monasteries, crypts,and even sewers or cisterns. The Cappadocians actingas scholars or advisors enjoyed a better standard of unlife, but even they often chose places that mortals hadno interest in exploring.

	Appearance:The Graverobbers were pale andcorpse-like, even for vampires. Their hair often darkened slightly after the Embrace, giving them even more of an ethereal appearance. The Cappadocians dressedappropriately for their station and role.

	Character Creation:Mental Attributes and Knowledges were often primary, and rare was the Cappadocian without at least a few dots of Occult. The Clanincluded warriors as well as scholars and priests, anda Cappadocian who chose to be a tyrant could be afrightening creature indeed. For the most part, though,the Clan tended more toward intellectual and spiritualpursuits, and choices of Abilities and Backgrounds reflected that. 

	Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Fortitude, Necromancy

	Weaknesses:As mentioned, the Cappadocians exhibited a deathly pallor, and this only worsened as thevampire grew older. Young Cappadocians were ableto pass for human (though mortals that knew what tolook for could pick them out easily), but elder Cappadocians showed shriveled skin and a much more withered countenance.

	Clan Cappadocian was, in its heyday,an important Clan historically. It claimed domain in several important cities across Europe, and it wasn’tuncommon for Graverobbers to act as spiritual or mystical advisors to other medieval Princes. Internally, theClan had little strict hierarchy, though as the yearswore on the Clan’s core became more localized aroundthe founder (which, in turn, allowed the Giovanni totake it over).



--Children of Osiris

	*Egyptian mythology abounds with tales of the rivalrybetween Set and his brother, Osiris. Knowledgeablevampires are aware that the Followers of Set claim descent from an Antediluvian who took his name fromthat Egyptian serpent-god (though the Setites certainly seem to think Set actually was the god). If that’s the case, such Kindred wonder, who was Osiris? A mortalspellcaster that was Embraced? Set’s childe? Or perhapsanother Antediluvian, lost to time and destroyed millennia ago?Whatever the truth about Set, there was once a powerful vampire called Osiris. He was a philosopher anda scholar in an Egyptian court (whose dynasty is unknown), Embraced by an unknown vampire who believed that his knowledge of the law would make hima useful ally in the battle to bring Egypt under Kindredinfluence. Osiris, however, was horrified by his newcondition. Rather than meet the sun, though, he became determined to face and banish his personal demons, and especially his own Beast. His studies on 
sublimating the vampiric impulses may have helped formthe basis for the search for Golconda. At the very least,they expanded it.The Children of Osiris might have become a Clanand continued into the modern nights, but Set slewOsiris. As mortal legendry has it, Set dismembered his“brother” and scattered his body throughout the landof Egypt. His sister, Isis (perhaps another vampire, butno one still extant seems to know for sure) found thepieces and reassembled them, and impossibly, Osiriswas resurrected. Death, however, had taken its toll. Hisblood was inert, and he could no longer create morechilder. This, however, did not stop him from spreading his path.

	Nickname: Since even the Kindred who know about the Children of Osiris assume them all to be dead, theydo not have a common nickname.

	Background:Children of Osiris renounce their Clans because they hate their condition, but do notwish to commit suicide. The search for Golconda leadssome Kindred to the Children, while others encounterthe Sect after running afoul of the Followers of Set.

	Sect:Strictly speaking, the Children of Osiris are aSect, rather than a bloodline. They do not (and, byvirtue of their own laws, cannot) join the Sabbat orthe Camarilla.

	Haven:The few remaining Children of Osiris in theworld dwell in one of several temples. These templesare well-hidden and kept secret from other Kindred, meaning that they tend to be in areas that don’t boastmuch of a vampire population.

	Appearance:Since the Children can hail from anyClan or bloodline, their appearance can vary widely.They all shave their heads every evening upon awakening, and when in their temples they wear white robesadorned with mystical symbols and hieroglyphs. Whenleaving their temples on business, they dress simplyand stay inconspicuous.

	Character Creation:Children of Osiris can be fromany Clan (except the Followers of Set; while the Children might be willing to accept a truly repentant Setite, the situation has never come up). The charactercan have any combination of Attributes and Abilities,and they retain whatever knowledge of Disciplinesthey had before joining. Nature and Demeanor tend tobe the same — the Children of Osiris are straightforward and honest.

	Clan Disciplines: As appropriate for the character’soriginal Clan. Children of Osiris can also learn Bardoas an in-Clan Discipline.

	Weaknesses:As appropriate for the character’s original Clan.

	Organization:Each temple is under the supervisionof an elder Child of Osiris (called the Undying King),and the entire Sect answers to a mysterious vampirecalled the Grand Undying King, rumored to be a direct childe of Osiris from before he lost the ability toEmbrace. The Sect focuses on maintaining their Humanity, which is of course a difficult enough concern,but also thwarting the machinations of the Followersof Set without the Serpents knowing they still exist.



--Lamia

	*The Lamia were a bloodline of Cainites devotedto defending Clan Cappadocian. The founder of thebloodline, Lamia, claimed to be a daughter of Lilith,Adam’s first wife. According to legend, a Cappadocianelder named Lazarus found her performing sacred ritesto Lilith, the Dark Mother. Impressed by her skill andperhaps taken with her fierce beauty, he Embraced her. While she died and the Change took her, Lilith gaveher a vision, a deep understanding of her future andthat of the Cappadocians. When she recovered, shewhispered something to Lazarus, and the Cappadocianelder fled in terror.Lamia did find her way back to the Clan, though,and her bloodline became the guardians of the Cappadocians. They were never very numerous, but important Graverobbers often had at least one Gorgonstanding at their side. The Lamia learned to feed sparingly, since their bite carried disease, and developedtheir own path of Necromancy based on the four humors. Over the centuries, they became an importantresour
ce for the Cappadocians. And yet, behind theirloyalty was perhaps a greater dedication to the DarkMother and to the vision of their founder.The Revelation of the Dark Mother seems to haveled the line to tragedy, however. The Lamia died defending the Cappadocians when the Giovanni subsumed the Clan. Augustus Giovanni murdered Lamiaherself following his diablerie of Cappadocius, and thelast known member of the bloodline was destroyed in1718 as part of a Camarilla blood hunt.

	Nickname:Gorgons

	Background:Since the Lamia Embraced womenalmost exclusively, they seldom had the chance toEmbrace trained warriors. Instead, the Gorgons oftenchose women who had some experience with death.Women who had attempted or contemplated suicide,or had recently committed murder, were commonchoices. Likewise, women with a pronounced interest in black magic or scholarly pursuits in general werecandidates for the Lamia Embrace. Training in combatcould come after the gift of immortality.

	Sect:The Lamia were somewhere between the Highand Low Clans. They were not a Clan, but were considered part of Clan Cappadocian in most Cainites’understanding. Other Cainites, however, treated themrespectfully as servants or soldiers, both out of deference to their skills and to their patrons.

	Haven:The Lamia shared havenswith their Cappadocian patrons. Whenthey made their own, they often chosecrypts and sarcophagi, preferring to be alone among the dead (feeding on the recently deadalso minimized their chance of starting an outbreak ofplague).

	Appearance:The Lamia did not share the Cappadocians’ pallor. Many of them were of Mediterranean or Semitic descent, though as theCappadocians traveled across Europewith their Gorgonbodyguards, othernationalities cameinto the bloodline aswell. The bloodline waspredominantly female, but it wasn’t uncommon for Lamia to dress as men (usually armed and armored).

	Character Creation:All Lamia had some combattraining, usually from their sires. Physical or MentalAttributes might be primary, as were Skills. The Lamiaalso tended to have some familiarity with Occult, bothfrom the rites taught to them by their own bloodlineand simply by proximity to the Cappadocians.

	Clan Disciplines: Fortitude, Necromancy, Potence

	Weaknesses:The Lamia carried the “Seed of Lilith,” awasting disease spread by their bite. Anyone the Lamiafed upon was required to make a Stamina roll (difficulty 6 for women, 8 for men). If the roll failed, thevictim contracted a Black Plague-like pox that was fatal within several days. Any vampire that consumedLamia blood became a carrier of the disease until all ofthe Lamia vitae had been purged from his body.

	Organization:The sire-childe relationship in the Lamia was very strong, as most Lamia had to remain withtheir sires for at least a year to achieve the necessarycombat skill to be of use. Lamia remained the leaderof the bloodline until her destruction, but her first andmost important order to her daughter was to serve theCappadocians.



--Lhiannan

	*The Lhiannan boasted a strange creation story. Theyclaimed that their founder — a vampire simply knownas the Crone — became bonded with a spirit of theforests. This spirit was a desperate, jealous being thatcould apparently see that people would destroy the forests and burn the trees that comprised them. Joiningwith an undying predator, then, was apparently thespirit’s attempt at dodging this fate. Whether or notany of that is true, the Lhiannan did have a connectionto the natural world that no other vampire, not eventhe Gangrel, can equal. Whenever a Lhiannan Embraced, a shard of that original spirit broke off and empowered the new Cainite.This spirit-shard allowed Lhiannan to use their OghamDiscipline, which, in turn, enabled the style of unlifethat the Lhiannan enjoyed. It also made the Lhiannan territorial above all else, and the Druids were quitelimited in their mobility. The Lhiannan, much like theTelyavelic Tremere (see p. 438) found common causewith the pagan peoples o
f Europe. This, unfortunately,put them into conflict with Cainites and mortals whofollowed the Christian faith.The bloodline was never numerous (especially sincecreating a new Lhiannan meant that the sire grewweaker), but the fires of the Inquisition and the spreadof the Christian religion took a harsh toll on the Druids. By the end of the 14th century, they had all beendestroyed. In modern times, though, Gangrel traderumors of powerful Kindred in European forests decorated with strange, bloody symbols, so perhaps someof them survived — or perhaps the forest spirit thatinitially created the bloodline has resurfaced.

	Nickname:Druids

	Background:Since performing the Embrace meantgrowing weaker, the Druids only created childer outof sheer loneliness or when they found someone whotruly impressed them. A pagan spirit-speaker with realdevotion to her craft, or a woodsman with impeccablerespect for the forests might be enough to get a Lhiannan’s attention. The Lhiannan refused to EmbraceChristians, Jews, or Muslims.

	Sect:The Lhiannan did not survive to see the dawning of the Sabbat or the Camarilla. In historicalnomenclature, they were decidedly on the LowClan side of the social divide, and most Cainitesprobably wouldn’t have known them from theGangrel. Lhiannan rarely joined coteries, limitedas they were in mobility.

	Haven:The Lhiannan made their havens in theforests of Europe, constructing simple dwellings orfinding natural shelter. They would sometimes find a man-made haven and kill or enslave the inhabitants,or very rarely eke out an existence on the periphery ofhuman civilization by taking the role of a shaman orwise woman.

	Appearance:The Druids resembled the native people of the regions of Europe that they called home —the British Isles, for the most part.

	Character Creation:All Lhiannan were capable ofsurviving in the wilderness, and so Physical Attributes,Skills, and Talents were important. A Lhiannan actingas a counsel to a mortal settlement was likely to havehigher Social Attributes and appropriate Abilities.Herd and Retainers (animals) were common Backgrounds.

	Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Ogham, Presence

	Weaknesses:The Lhiannan were part nature spirit,and the mark of their inhumanity ran strong withinthem. All difficulties to detect their nature via Auspex were reduced by two, and even normal humans feltvaguely uncomfortable in their presence. Additionally,any Lhiannan who left her territory became agitated— all dice pools were reduced by one die per week (toa minimum of the character’s Stamina) that she wasgone. Once she re-entered her territory, her dice poolsreturned to normal within a few hours.

	Organization:Once a Lhiannan Embraced a child, she generally kept the new vampire around for a fewyears until that childe was ready to fend for himself (andthe novelty of having someone else around wore off).The sire would then send the childe away to find his own haven and territory. The Lhiannan were generallyaware of members of their bloodline whose territorieswere adjacent, but there was no system of communication in place. This, of course, may have contributed totheir eventual destruction.



--Noiad

	*Few Kindred have ever beheld the Northern Lights.The trek to the far reaches of the world, in a place inhospitable to man, beast, or vampire, with no reliableway to feed is enough to put even the most curiousCainite off the idea. And yet, a bloodline of vampiresmanaged to dwell close enough to see these lights ona regular basis. This line — the Noiad — felt it wastheir sacred duty to witness the Northern Lights andinterpret the will of the gods. Their mortal charges, anomadic tribe called the Samí, lived in fearand awe of their godlike protectors.The Noiad defended the Samí fromoutside threats, both natural and supernatural, and acted as shamans and teachersfor these wanderers. In return, the Samí gave oftheir blood and kept the Noiad safe during thelong months with no darkness. Of course, the touch of the Kindred corrupts everything. The Noiad protected the Samí from monsters from the wastes, and their blood allowed themortals to survive times of famine, but the Wanderers a
lso refused to allow their mortal herds tochange or improve. Interlopers were turned asideor killed, regardless of their intentions. When itbecame clear that the march of Christianity (andLasombra working within the Church) could notbe stopped, the Noiad pushed the Samí furthernorth, away from the herds that would sustainthem and away from the dawning of a newera. Whether the Noiad saw something in theNorthern Lights that spurred them to this decision, or whether it was simply fear of change, isnot important in the end. The Noiad drove theSamí almost to destruction.

	Nickname:Wanderers

	Background:The Samí selected for Embrace tendedto be those with talent for divination, as well as dreamand star interpretation. The Noiad also watched children descended from families that included at least one vampire, looking for the traits they favored. Physicalitywas not a primary concern, but only because Samí thatwere not physically capable of thriving in the harshclimates didn’t live long enough to be considered forthe Embrace anyway.

	Sect:The Noiad never belonged to a Sect, and werelargely apart from the vampire politics of the day (atleast until war pushed far enough north to inconvenience them). As a Gangrel offshoot, other Cainiteswould have considered them a Low Clan, on the rareoccasion that other Cainites learned enough aboutthem to have opinions at all.

	Haven:The Samí constructed mobile “havens” thatcould be dragged behind them as they traveled by day.If terrain or numbers made this impossible, the Samíwould watch in awe as their heavenly protectors sankinto the earth, only to rejoin them the next night.

	Appearance:The Noiad dwelled openly among theSamí, and Embraced exclusively from this population.Most Noaid were dark-haired and strongly built fromtheir demanding lifestyles pre-Embrace. Their skin tone, of course, tended to be lighter than their stillliving comrades.

	Character Creation:Physical Attributes weren’tnecessarily primary, but tended to be no worse thanaverage. All Noiad had good ratings in Survival andAnimal Ken, and at least a dot or two in Athletics, andMelee. Finally, all Noiad had at least a dot of the HerdBackground.

	Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Auspex, Protean

	Weaknesses:The Noiad were so intrinsically tied tothe Samí and to their role as the divine protectors ofthe tribe that one of the legends about them came true.The Samí’s protectors, it was said, could not sup fromanimals, but could only take sustenance from the bloodof the chosen (that is, the Samí). The Noiad, in fact,could not drink from animals, though they were capable of drinking from any mortal or Cainite, regardlessof nationality or ethnicity.

	Organization:The Noiad usually saw one anotherwhen they came to witness the Northern Lights (thisalso gave them the opportunity to make sure the godswere all telling them the same things). The Noiad alsoused animals, either ghouls or those controlled by theAnimalism Discipline, to keep in some kind of contact.
